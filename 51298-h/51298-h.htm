<div>
  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>Introductory.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c007'>The industrial and economic development of the past two decades
has opened many new lines of special work in the Profession of
Engineering, none of which is more difficult and complicated or of
greater ultimate value to the public at large than that of the appraisal
or valuation of the property owned and operated by public service
corporations; and none of the fields of engineering specialization
requires greater care or calls for more skill, experience, integrity, or
sound judgment.</p>

<p class='c000'>The individual engineer, or commission of engineers, entering
upon an appraisal of large magnitude, particularly one including properties
of more than one company, will find conditions varying in every
one, and each property presenting new, complex, and confusing elements
of value to pass upon and determine.</p>

<p class='c000'>Prior to 1900 there had been few calls on engineers for large
appraisals, and the literature descriptive of engineering effort along
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>this line was practically nothing. Since 1900 many extensive appraisals
have been undertaken by States, by railroad and banking corporations,
and by cities; certain well-defined lines of practice have been
developed; many differing opinions as to certain methods and principles
have been brought out; and enough has been added to the printed
literature to enable one to compare methods of work and to fix with reasonable
certainty upon some as correct, and to discard others as improper.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are so many complex factors entering into the problem of
valuation, so many widely different plans have been presented, and
there are so many thinking men who have opposed and do honestly
and sincerely oppose any form of valuation, that a most thorough study
of the subject should be made. It should be examined from all angles,
and every possibility of danger from legislation regarding it should be
weighed with utmost care.</p>

<p class='c000'>The question of railroad valuation, involving as it does the largest
industry of the nation, naturally takes first place in such a discussion,
but so many of the general principles of railroad valuation are
applicable to the appraisement of corporate property, so many arguments
have been advanced by engineers and others, and so many
judgments of the Courts have been rendered in connection with water-works
and gas-works valuations, that it is not desirable to limit this
discussion wholly to the problem of railroad valuations.</p>

<p class='c000'>The reasons for requiring that valuations be made may be broadly
divided into two general classes:</p>

<p class='c000'><em>First.—As a Matter of Public Interest.</em>—The public, and particularly
the investing public, requires valuations in order to guard
against unworthy and dishonest corporation securities, to be assured
that corporations are bearing their legitimate and proper share of the
burden of taxation, and to furnish a proper basis for fixing equitable
and just rates for the services rendered by the corporation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Under this class would come all appraisals made for information
to be used as a basis for legislation relative to:</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>a</em>) <em>Taxation of Corporations.</em>—Such were the valuations in
Michigan and Wisconsin.</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>b</em>) <em>Rate Regulation.</em>—This was the reason which prompted the
work in Minnesota and Nebraska.</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>c</em>) <em>Limitation of Capitalization.</em>—The regulation of issue of
stocks and bonds was the purpose of the Texas valuation.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>(<em>d</em>) <em>Fixing a Price for Sale.</em>—Many of the water-works and
electric light valuations were made in order to determine a
fair price to be paid for the property at the expiration of the
franchise.</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>e</em>) <em>The General Information of the Public.</em>—To be used in connection
with the fixing of terms for franchise renewals,
etc., etc.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Second.—As a Matter of Corporation Necessity or Expediency.</em>—Valuations
are made in order to guide large investors, to secure a
safe and up-to-date basis on which to negotiate a sale, a purchase, or
a reorganization of the property, or a consolidation with other like
properties, and to secure justice to honestly administered corporations.</p>

<p class='c000'>The great majority of appraisals under this head have been in
accordance with some other methods than those adopted in the State
valuations. It is not intended in this paper to engage in any argument
as to the various purposes of appraisals, or even to urge the necessity
or desirability of a general appraisal of properties. An absolutely
accurate and correct statement of the cost of reproduction of all the
physical properties of the railroads of the country, a correct statement
of the actual capital needed to reproduce these properties as they exist,
and, along with this, a statement of the actual physical depreciation,
would be a document of vital interest.</p>

<p class='c000'>This paper is confined to a discussion of the methods which should
be used in arriving at a correct figure of cost of reproduction and
depreciation—it does not take up questions involving the propriety of
those figures when reached. The propriety or legality of using such
figures as a basis for an assessed valuation, as a basis for rate-making
(rate-making being an art in itself involving complications as great as
those encountered in valuation), or any arguments as to the justice or
injustice of legislation restricting issues of stocks or bonds, will be
conceded no place in this paper. It is assumed that all these questions
would have been taken up and a satisfactory answer reached before a
valuation could have been ordered.</p>

<p class='c000'>The different elements of value in property, the relations of this
property to the public, the method of determining the worth of these
elements of value which have been adopted in the past by men engaged
on valuation work, a comparison of these methods, a discussion of the
objections that have been made to them, and a presentation, not only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>of the writer's views as to proper methods, but those in which he disagrees
with usages adopted by others—these define the scope of this
paper.</p>

<p class='c000'>No matter what particular end is to be served by a valuation, the
commission engaged upon it will be asked to furnish a fair value,
perhaps with reasonable limitations in the instructions, perhaps with
a general and indefinite instruction to find the value. They will
encounter, among other difficulties:</p>

<p class='c000'><em>First.</em>—The fact that human machines are not exact duplicates,
and that allowance must be made for a large measure of error, on
account of the personal equation of the men engaged on the work, as
individual errors of judgment are frequent on any work of magnitude.
This personal element must be corrected by uniformity of method, by
constant checking, and, as far as possible, by subordination of personality
to system.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Second.</em>—The fact that human selfishness is a dominant quality—the
railroad manager who opposes methods which he believes will
increase values in an appraisal for taxation, or who, on the other
hand, uses every possible argument to increase values if the work be
as a basis for rate-making or for restriction of bond issues, or the
State official who is desirous of using original cost on a valuation to
be used for rate-making in order to keep the valuation down to a
minimum, and the politician who depends on an unenlightened public
opinion to create sufficient outcry to influence the work to his advantage—are
all actuated by a perfectly human wish to attain ends which
seem to them desirable, and are but typical of men who will endeavor
to influence every appraisal.</p>

<p class='c000'>In view of these considerations, it is a question whether results are
not frequently affected by the knowledge of their intended use, and
whether a system which will entirely remove such causes of error can
be applied to the work.</p>

<p class='c000'>If an engineer, or a commission of engineers, is directed to
examine a certain property and report the true cost of reproduction,
depreciation, or present value, taking into account all facts connected
therewith, the final figures should not differ, whether the report is to
be used as a basis for reorganization, sale to another corporation, or is
to be used by a State legislature as a basis for formulating a rate
bill, or as a basis for a value for taxation. The result secured is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>necessary preliminary on which depends the accuracy, fairness, and
justice of the other work which is to follow. This is an engineering
work, a statement of certain physical property, the estimated cost of
reproducing it new, less the estimated depreciation, and, beyond the
differences due to personal judgment, these figures may not vary.</p>

<p class='c000'>The word "value" is in common use, and yet, in the minds of many
people, its exact meaning is vague. It is true that the "value" of a
property is an unstable figure, subject to fluctuations due to natural
or artificial causes, and that a material change in value may occur
suddenly, but the "value" of any given property on any given date is,
or should be, from an engineering standpoint, a definite sum which
may not be varied or changed to suit the whim or will of the people
for whom the work is done.</p>

<p class='c000'>In all the subsequent discussion of values and methods of obtaining
values, it is assumed that, unless specifically limited to a determination
of cost of reproduction and depreciation, a valuation commission
should be governed by the following rules:</p>

<p class='c000'><em>1.</em>—No account may be taken of the purpose for which the resultant
figure of value is to be used; and the result should not vary, no matter
what that purpose may be.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>2.</em>—The resultant figure should be the honest judgment of the men
composing the commission, as to the actual cost of reproduction,
present physical value, or "fair value," and should be ascertained by a
systematic and scientific method which takes into account all the
facts concerning the property, its physical value, its strategic location,
its operating revenues and expenses, and its franchises, rights, competition,
opposition, and all other tangible or intangible elements
which would affect values. The method of valuation should be such
as to minimize or entirely eliminate all differences due to errors of
personal judgment.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>3.</em>—All properties being appraised are considered as operating
properties. One which is dead, inert, and not in use, cannot be
considered as coming under such a discussion as this, and such
properties are not treated in this paper. The term "going concern"
is not used in connection with the physical property, any element of
value implied by the term, over and above the "overhead charges,"
being treated as an intangible or non-physical element of value.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>In stating this position, the writer is aware that it is a difficult
matter indeed to get away from the fact that some specific purpose—taxation,
for example—is the definite end in view in every valuation,
and that, instinctively, men engaged on the appraisal will find themselves
modifying their figures to meet some real or fancied condition
which they conceive might arise, or to prevent some injustice which
they believe might be done. Every subordinate employee needs to be
watched, every man in charge must watch himself, or he will find
himself unwittingly, almost instinctively, coloring his results by some
old prejudice of his early years of employment, or some loyalty to his
own ideas of governmental or economic policy. The writer has noted
this in every appraisal on which he has been engaged, and calls particular
attention to it as the first difficulty which must be overcome in
the organization of the force for a large appraisal.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the following pages all complications which might arise from the
purpose of the appraisement are considered as eliminated, and the
possibility of erroneous conclusions being reached by reason of the
personal factor (while recognized as being ever present) will not be
specially emphasized.</p>

</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>The Relation of Public Service, or Quasi-public Corporations, <br /> to the People.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c007'>In reference to questions of value, the engineering commission
must hear, consider, and reconcile arguments advanced by adverse and
often hostile interests. On the one side stand the corporations, with
large financial interests involved, often with an excessive amount of
stock and bonds issued on the property, the existence of which issues
the corporation wishes to justify, and, whether properly capitalized or
not, the management being imbued with the perfectly human desire to
defend corporate interests from attack of any kind; on the other
side is public opinion, often unreasonable, often misinformed, and
frequently prejudiced.</p>

<p class='c000'>It appears necessary, therefore, to consider briefly the relation
which these interests bear to one another, to study the causes which
have led to mutual misunderstandings, and to note the proper relations
which should, if possible, be established and maintained between the
people and those corporations organized to perform certain of the
functions of the State.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>A public service or quasi-public corporation is a corporation which
is operating under the terms of rights, grants, or franchises given by
the public, either to this particular corporation direct or granted by
statute to a class of corporations.</p>

<p class='c000'>The property of the corporation is used to render certain services
to the public, with the expectation of financial gain.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is not material whether the grant be a franchise permitting a
water-works company to use the streets and alleys of a city for its
mains, and the service be the pumping of water for domestic service
and fire protection, or whether the grant be the statutory rights of
corporate existence and eminent domain, and the service rendered be
the transportation of freight and passengers; the general principle is
the same; the company has secured from the people certain rights
which enable it to do business, and the people are directly benefited
by the services rendered by the company. The increased comfort of
living makes for the growth of the city; the increased transportation
facilities build and develop the country traversed by the railroad; and
this growth and development, not only operate to the advantage of the
people, but also to that of the company in the way of increased business
and increased revenues.</p>

<p class='c000'>The capital required to build and develop these properties was
furnished in the hope of, and with the expectation of, a proper financial
reward. It has frequently happened that such properties have been
built years in advance of sufficient development to support the enterprise,
built, in fact, without expectation of immediate returns, and long
periods of time have often elapsed before any profit has been secured.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has also frequently happened that corporations have been aided
to a very large extent by public funds, by the voting of aid bonds,
by the donation of large tracts of land, by payment for certain service
at such rates as would largely relieve the company from loss in operation,
by the remission of taxes, or by the direct donation of funds.</p>

<p class='c000'>The company is clearly entitled to earn a reasonable profit on the
actual capital invested, in addition to the legitimate cost of operation,
payment of taxes, and sinking funds to cover depreciation and
obsolescence.</p>

<p class='c000'>The public is clearly entitled to good service at the lowest rates
that will permit the company to earn its reasonable profit and expenses.
Increases in tonnage, population, and consequent net earnings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>of the corporation should entitle the public to a benefit in reduced
charges for service, when the increased earning is of a permanent
character.</p>

<p class='c000'>The general tendency of the Courts has been to treat a franchise
as a contract, and to be governed closely by the language and evident
intent of the makers, but to safeguard the rights of the public to the
fullest extent consistent with justice.</p>

<p class='c000'>A franchise requires specific performance of specific acts. Nothing
will be assumed or implied. The Courts recognize that the investors
are entitled to reasonable returns, and that the public is entitled to
fair rates.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the case of Los Angeles Water Company <em>vs.</em> City of Los Angeles
(103 U. S., 711), the United States Courts held that at the expiration
of a 30-year franchise, which provided that the city was to pay for the
value of all improvements, when the city failed to agree upon, tender,
or pay such value, so long as the company complied with the terms of
the contract, and until the city terminated it by making or tendering
payment, the passage of an ordinance by the city fixing rates was void.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the case of Weatherly <em>vs.</em> Capital City Water Company (Ala. 22
So., 140), the Alabama Courts held that the acceptance of a franchise
involved a grave responsibility, and that the company could not stop
furnishing water and fire protection, even if the work was done at a loss.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the case of Myer <em>vs.</em> Brown (65 Cal., 589), the Court said:</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is well occasionally to recall the fact that there is no more
reason to permit a municipal government to repudiate its obligations
entered into for value, than to permit an individual to do so. Good
faith and fair dealing should be exacted of one equally with the
other."</p>

<p class='c000'>Judge Brewer, in the Kansas City Water-Works case (62 Fed.
Rep., 853), said:</p>

<p class='c000'>"All contracts involving property rights and obligations, between
municipalities and individuals, must be presumed to be based upon
and to recognize the ordinary laws of business transactions."</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1903 the Maine Supreme Court issued a set of instructions to
appraisers appointed to fix values of certain properties. The Court
set forth its views as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>"Summarized, these elemental principles are, the right of the company
to derive a fair income based upon the fair value of the property
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>at the time it is being used for the public, taking into account the
cost of maintenance and depreciation and the current operating
expenses, and the right of the public to demand that the rates shall be
no higher than the services are worth to them, not in the aggregate, but
as individuals."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Supreme Court of the United States has again and again
given its views, which may be summarized as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>"It cannot be said that a corporation is entitled, as of right, without
reference to the interests of the public, to realize a given per cent. upon
its capital stock. When a question arises whether the legislature has
exceeded its constitutional powers in prescribing rates to be charged
by a corporation controlling a public highway, stockholders are not
the only persons whose rights and interests are to be considered. The
rights of the public are not to be ignored.</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c000'>"The public cannot properly be subjected to unreasonable rates in
order simply that stockholders may earn dividends. The legislature
has the authority in every case, where its power has not been restrained
by contract, to proceed upon the ground that the public may not rightfully
be required to submit to unreasonable exactions for the use of
a public highway established and maintained under legislative authority."
(164 U. S., 578.)</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is not to be inferred that the power of limitation or regulation
is itself without limit. This power to regulate is not a power
to destroy, and limitation is not the equivalent of confiscation. Under
pretense of regulating fares and freights the State cannot require a
railroad corporation to carry persons or property without reward,
neither can it do that which in law amounts to the taking of private
property for public use without just compensation. * * *" (116
U. S., 307.)</p>

<p class='c000'>In the case of Smyth <em>vs.</em> Ames (169 U. S., 466), the Court said:</p>

<p class='c000'>"If a railroad corporation has bonded its property for an amount
that exceeds its fair value, or if its capitalization is largely fictitious,
it may not impose upon the public the burden of such increased rates
as may be required for the purpose of realizing profits upon such
excessive valuation or fictitious capitalizations; and the apparent value
of the property and franchises used by the corporations, as represented
by its stocks, bonds and obligations, is not alone to be considered when
determining the rates that may reasonably be charged. * * *</p>

<p class='c000'>"We hold, however, that the basis of all calculations as to the
reasonableness of rates to be charged by a corporation maintaining a
highway under legislative sanction must be the fair value of the property
being used by it for the convenience of the public.</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>"What the company is entitled to ask is a fair return upon the value
of that which it employs for the public convenience. On the other
hand, what the public is entitled to demand is that no more be exacted
from it for the use of a public highway than the services rendered
by it are reasonably worth."</p>

<p class='c000'>The relations between the corporations and the public that they
serve have been clearly defined by the Courts, as the foregoing quotations
show.</p>

<p class='c000'>That the mutual relations existing between the management of the
corporations and the public are far from what they should be, there
can be no doubt. On the one hand, the great mass of the voting public
is uninformed as to actual revenues, disbursements, and operations of
the corporations, as to whether their income is unreasonably large,
or whether they are struggling to exist. The sums of money involved
in the dealings of the corporations are so stupendous in comparison
with the amounts used in an ordinary private business—even in one of
considerable magnitude—that the majority of the public cannot comprehend
them. The published statistics are in such form that only the
careful student of affairs can understand or analyze them, and but
few of the public officials who receive them are able to read the reports
of the properties and comprehend them. As a consequence, the corporation,
as a political issue, has been the subject of jest, gibe, and
cartoon; there has not been an intelligent public discussion of available
reports and statistics, and it may be said that, generally, the mass of
the public has come to class all corporations as grasping, overbearing,
and unjust, and to consider them all as exceedingly prosperous. This
has been taken advantage of by politicians for their own selfish ends,
and has led to sundry legislation, some of which has been unreasonable
and unjust to the corporations, and much of which is aimed at
real abuses that never ought to have existed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The reasonableness of a rate depends, not alone on the amount
of capital invested, but on the volume of traffic, the density of population,
the actual cost of service, and many other elements. Rate legislation
has been attempted without full investigation. Acts have been
passed compelling the establishment of stations and terminals, the
improvement of roadway and structures, the purchase of new equipment,
the installation of safety appliances and block signals, and many
other requirements have been made, some (but by no means all) of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>which are unreasonable and burdensome. Nearly one-half the States
of the Union have by law required a 2-cent, or 2½-cent, passenger fare,
regardless of density of population, amount of traffic, or other considerations
which might render such rates unreasonable. The regulation
of the carriers, by legislature, by railroad commissions, by State
officials, and by Courts, the addition of burdens of expense, and the
cutting off of revenue, all give considerable ground for the opposition
of the carriers to anything that looks like hostile legislation, and
compels the student of affairs to admit that there is justice in the
claim of the managements, that there is grave danger, not only of
seriously crippling many roads, but of so impairing the credit of the
railroads as a class that it will be increasingly difficult to secure capital
to provide for the necessary extensions and development of the transportation
facilities of the country.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the other hand, perfect frankness compels the admission that
the state of public opinion which compelled the passage of these laws
has been caused largely by the corporation officials themselves. There
is probably no more loyal body of men in America to-day than the
officials and employees of railroads. Their loyalty, however, is all to
"our company." They enter its service as boys or young men; they
grow up to the full strength of manhood working for its good; they
take little or no part in public affairs; they have no time for the
study of public questions. Their friends are almost exclusively among
their own associates in the service of the road, and their development
is along the lines of their own special work in the service. As a body
of honest, honorable, and worthy men, absolutely loyal to their employers,
they have few equals; but it is doubtful if any equal number of
men, of equal intelligence, have as limited a knowledge of the fundamental
truths of government, or knowledge so colored by bias. It is
also doubtful whether any equal number of men have in their ranks
so few who bear an active part in the duties and activities of citizenship,
or who exercise large influence on their neighbors.</p>

<p class='c000'>While the foregoing statement is believed to be absolutely true,
it will not do to pass over the notable exceptions. Such men as
James J. Hill, F. Am. Soc. C. E., M. E. Ingalls, and others of
the higher officials, who have taken an active part in public affairs,
have had commanding influence. Theirs has been the sound policy, as
the property in their hands has not suffered. The short-sighted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>policy which, in December, 1909, induced the management of one road
to compel all its employees holding municipal offices to resign, is bound
to react and create hostile feeling on the part of the public.</p>

<p class='c000'>The entire trend of a training in railway service is to fill a man
with prejudice against all things that undertake to regulate or control
the corporations, and often goes so far as to enable him to do,
willingly and as a matter of right, things which with a broader view
of the interest of the whole community he would not agree with at all.
The result of this intensive training is that the railway service has in
it thousands of men who become impatient with any effort to regulate
or control; who permit their irritation to show; and who, by their own
attitude, create unnecessary hostility. F. A. Delano, M. Am. Soc.
C. E., President of the Wabash, in an address<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c003'><sup>[2]</sup></a> at Hannibal, Mo., on
March 25th, 1909, said:</p>

<p class='c000'>"In ordinary manufacturing or commercial undertakings, every
man has his own notions about the conduct of his business, and does
not want to be interfered with, or dictated to by people who know less
about his business than he does himself. Now, while it may be
argued in the case of public service corporations that the people who
have put their money into these enterprises, have done it with their
eyes open and with full knowledge that they were subject to governmental
regulation and control, there is nothing in that argument
which makes public interference any more palatable to the man or
group of men who are interfered with."</p>

<p class='c000'>This address well expresses the spirit of the railway managers and
employees toward all forms of investigation, and the complete lack of
understanding, on the part of these managers, of the legal and moral
relations which they bear to the communities which they serve. It is
extremely unfortunate that railway and corporation people have not
taken the public fully into their confidence, and fully and freely given
out correct information as to the operation and depreciation of their
properties; also, it is unfortunate that, when a corporation official
does feel a grievance, he permits himself to make a partisan speech,
or write an unwise article for publication. Much hostility is traceable
to foolish, undiplomatic sayings or writings of corporation managers
(which are often but half quoted), or to equally foolish speeches
or newspaper editorials in opposition to the corporations, which are
taken seriously by the managers. Whatever may be the cause, there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>is a regrettable hostility, and, on the part of the corporation officials,
there is an apparent unwillingness to admit right motives to anyone
advancing theories regarding corporate regulation and control, due
largely to the training and atmosphere surrounding the corporate
service.</p>

<p class='c000'>The public has a large bill of particulars, one of which is the promotion
of wildcat companies, such, for instance, as the "New York and
Chicago Air Line" project which, only a year or so ago, drew from
$2,000,000 to $3,000,000 from the people in a limited territory. These
people were "investing" in railway stocks. A Federal control of the
issue of stocks and bonds would have prevented this and hundreds
of like swindles. Any move to secure such a law has always been
opposed by the management of large and legitimately operated corporations,
under the impression that they are about to be persecuted, and,
naturally, the victim classes these corporations with the alleged one
that secured his money.</p>

<p class='c000'>The issue of stocks and bonds far in excess of any possible cost
or value of railroad, street railroad, and other properties, and the
making of large personal fortunes by the promoters, are matters of
such frequent occurrence that it is difficult, indeed, to dismiss them
with a mere denial. There is hardly a community of any size which
has not had its example of "consolidation," "combine," or "merger,"
which has resulted in the issue of excessive securities; and there is
hardly a citizen of any intelligence who has not either seen or had
experience with some form of corporation promotion carried on strictly
within the law, but which, nevertheless, in plain language, was a
swindle. These, to say nothing of some gigantic deals involving millions,
will sooner or later compel some form of regulation of the issues
of stocks and bonds. In the last analysis, it is the money of the
people, the hundreds of thousands of small investors, depositors in
banks, and owners of life insurance, whose money goes into corporation
securities, and, until the officers of the great railroads co-operate
in securing such forms of control of stock and bond issues as will make
impossible the purely speculative "wildcat" corporations, and thus safeguard
minor corporations, as to furnish at least reasonable security
to those whose money is invested, all forms of corporation security
must be under suspicion with the public, and the agitation for control
must continue.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>It is not, as Mr. Delano says, a case of put your money in with
your eyes wide open; it is an effort on the part of the people to safeguard
this form of corporate security in such a way that it can be
treated as any other form of sound investment. It should not be
necessary to require that all investors in corporate securities be financial
experts. It is the writer's opinion, based on his observation and
professional practice, that the railroads are not generally open to
charges of over-capitalization. While there are flagrant instances, the
chief culprits are among other classes of corporations. If such be the
fact, it would seem that the interests of the great railway corporations
would be in no wise jeopardized by sane and reasonable control.</p>

<p class='c000'>The theory of taxation is that every one shall bear his proportionate
burden of the cost of maintaining the government.</p>

<p class='c000'>Regardless of any opinions that may be held as to the propriety
of the methods adopted in the Interstate Commerce Commission's commercial
valuation of railroad properties, it will be conceded that the
results gave a set of figures for all the States of the Union, secured by a
uniform method of computation and distribution. Table 1, which is a
compilation from Tables 1 to 11 of Bulletin 21, shows clearly why, in
certain States, corporate taxation is a live issue, and if (as suggested
by Mr. Williams in his article, elsewhere referred to) amendment of
the Constitutions of some of the States is necessary, it is safe to
assume that the condition of inequality shown by this table is such as
to compel these changes.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is needless to cite further instances; enough has been said to
indicate:</p>

<p class='c005'><em>First.</em>—That the corporations and the public have such intimate
business relations that a blow at either must necessarily injure
the other seriously;</p>

<p class='c005'><em>Second.</em>—That the Courts have defined quite clearly the legal
relation existing between the two interests;</p>

<p class='c005'><em>Third.</em>—That there is lacking a proper spirit of mutual confidence,
and the two interests at the present time are generally hostile;</p>

<p class='c005'><em>Fourth.</em>—That there have been errors and abuses on the part of
both corporations and public; and</p>

<p class='c005'><em>Fifth.</em>—That capital invested in corporations is, and should be,
the money of the people, and should be safeguarded so as to
prevent its loss by manipulation, and insure a fair return.</p>

<p class='c000'>In concluding this subject, it may not be amiss to quote the
language of the Supreme Court in the Knoxville Water Case (212 U.
S., 1), as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>"Regulation of public service corporations, which perform their
duties under conditions of necessary monopoly, will occur with greater
and greater frequency as time goes on. It is a delicate and dangerous
function, and ought to be exercised with a keen sense of justice on
the part of the regulating body, met by a frank disclosure on the part
of the company to be regulated. The Courts ought not to bear the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>whole burden of saving property from confiscation, though they will
not be found wanting when the proof is clear.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The legislatures and subordinate bodies to whom the legislative
power has been delegated ought to do their part. Our social system
rests largely upon the sanctity of private property, and that State or
community which seeks to invade it will soon discover the error, in
the disaster that follows. The slight gain to the consumer, which he
would obtain from a reduction in the rates charged by Public Service
Corporations, is as nothing compared with his share in the ruin
which would be brought about by denying to private property its just
reward, thus unsettling values and destroying confidence. On the other
hand, the companies to be regulated will find it to their lasting interest
to furnish freely the information upon which a just regulation can
be based."</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>Explanation of Terms.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In order that there may be no doubt as to the exact meaning of
the terms used throughout this paper, a few definitions or explanations
are submitted:</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Appraisal, or Valuation.</em>—These words are used interchangeably,
and refer to the engineering work of determining the present worth of
both physical and intangible properties of corporations.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Cost of Reproduction.</em>—This expression refers to the estimate of
cost of reproducing the physical properties as they exist on the date
of the appraisal, all elements entering into the cost being considered
as new and not affected by the elements of depreciation or obsolescence.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Cost, or Original Cost.</em>—These terms refer to the actual amount of
money paid for the property, either when it was originally constructed,
or in its condition at the time of appraisal, the latter case being the
original cost plus the cost of additions and betterments, less abandoned,
replaced, or worn-out property. This figure ought to be represented
by the "book cost," but it is not often that "book cost" and "actual
cost" are the same.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Present Value, or Present Physical Value.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c003'><sup>[3]</sup></a></em>—These terms are used
in describing the physical property as reproduced after it is affected by
all elements of depreciation or appreciation. The use of the word
"value" in this expression is unfortunate, as it may lead to some
confusion. It must be kept clearly in mind that, where this term is
used, it refers only to physical property as depreciated, and is in no
case intended to refer to the final or "fair value" of the property.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span><em>Non-physical, or Intangible, Value.</em>—These terms are used to represent
those elements, entering into the final worth of the property as
a business concern, which arise out of the operation of the property
and are not attachable to the physical property.</p>

<p class='c000'>All the foregoing terms have to do with the determination of the
elements which enter into the final value.</p>

<p class='c000'>What is "value"? In defining the exact meaning of this term,
as applied to the property of a public service corporation, many elements
must be taken into account. Standard authorities give many
definitions of "value," none of which appears to meet fully the requirements
of the term as used herein. Before considering the elements
which enter into the value of corporation property, or attempting to
determine the methods to be used in fixing proper figures of worth
for each of these elements, it is proper and necessary to obtain a clear
definition of "value," the thing sought to be ascertained by the inquiry.</p>

<p class='c000'>The term, "commercial value," has been considered in place of
"value," but is not used because it is held to be more properly applicable
to the selling or exchanging value of fractional interests in the
property, and the methods of computing the commercial value of
securities which are in common use cannot be adopted in an engineering
valuation. The Standard Dictionary definition of "commercial
value" is:</p>

<p class='c000'>"The source of commercial value, according to different schools
of economists, is (1) the degree of want felt for a commodity as
shown in the relation of supply and demand, (2) the amount of labor
embodied in it, or (3) the cost of reproduction. Practically, commercial
value is that for which a thing can be sold or exchanged at
a given time and place."</p>

<p class='c000'>The definition given by Professor Adams is:</p>

<p class='c000'>"The estimate placed upon the worth of a property, regarded as a
business proposition."</p>

<p class='c000'>Both these definitions are in a measure involved, and the writer
considers that the term, "Commercial Value," is too narrow and
restricted to be properly used.</p>

<p class='c000'>As a definition of that estimate of worth which an engineering
commission should report as the result of a complete appraisal, the
writer submits the following:</p>

<p class='c000'>The value of a property is its estimated worth at a given time,
measured in money, taking into account all the elements which add
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>to its usefulness or desirability as a business or profit-earning proposition.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are two classes of elements entering into the final value:</p>

<p class='c000'><em>(1) The "Physical Property" Element of Value.</em>—This consists
of those things which are visible and tangible, capable of being
inventoried, their cost of reproduction determined, their depreciation
measured, and without which the property would be unable to produce
the commodity on the sale of which income depends. This physical
property is considered as an operating entity, and not as collateral of
inert and partly worn-out equipment, and, being so considered, carries,
as part of the physical value, those costs and charges which are an
inseparable part of the cost of construction but do not appear in the
inventory of the completed property.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>(2) The "Non-Physical" or "Intangible" Elements of Value.</em>—These
are those things which, added to or taken from the worth of
the physical property, make up the value, and include whatever accrues
to the property by reason of its operation, or by reason of grants,
contract rights, competition, or location, which at the time of appraisal
affect favorably or unfavorably the worth of the property.</p>

<p class='c000'>The worth of the physical property is primarily that on which
the value of the whole property rests.</p>

<p class='c000'>While it is clear that the worth of the physical property, being
the cost of reproduction less depreciation, is not necessarily the value
of the property, it is equally clear that the physical worth must bear
some very definite relation to value, and the writer is strongly of the
conviction that this relation is such that "value" cannot be ascertained
without a determination of physical worth. The physical property
element represents the investment on which a fair return is to be
earned, and in most cases an appraisal is necessary for the determination
of the amount of money actually invested. As illustration of the
fact that "physical value" and "value" are not the same, the case of
two railroads actually existing and in operation between two cities
in Michigan may be cited.</p>

<p class='c000'>Road "A" occupies a narrow valley through high and abrupt hills.
Its alignment is fair for hilly country; its maximum grade is 1 per
cent. It has a number of bridges, all short and low. Its cost of
reproduction might reasonably be placed at $28,000 per mile. A mining
town at one end ships a heavy tonnage down grade to a lake port at
the other.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>Road "B" was constructed several years later, and, being barred
from the only valley, built a line across the hills, involving heavy
grading, very long and high steel trestles, a longer line, maximum
grades of 2%, and a heavy climb from the mining town to the
summit before starting to drop to the lake. The cost of construction was
more than double that of Line "A," and the tonnage which can be
hauled in either direction is but a small fraction of that which can
be hauled with the same power by Road "A." A reasonable figure for
cost of reproduction may be given as $60,000 per mile.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c003'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Here is clearly a case where the older, less expensively built road
has a value as an earning proposition far in excess of that of the new
road. The rate on commodities does not affect the relative difference.
A higher rate, while permitting Road "B" to live, greatly adds to the
value of Road "A," while the latter can operate at a profit on rates
which would not permit Road "B" to pay expenses.</p>

<p class='c000'>This example indicates the existence of non-physical values, not only
positive in the case of Road "A," but also negative as to Road "B."</p>

<p class='c000'>Many properties have been built in the United States, representing
large investments of capital, which are not, and some of which
can never be, profitable business investments. In all such the physical
valuation will exceed the final value where the property is considered
as an operating concern, and a negative factor to cover improper location,
uneconomical design, ill-advised investment, or whatever the
trouble may be, should be applied.</p>

<p class='c000'>The physical property is that which enables the corporation to do
business. Without physical property it could not produce the commodity
which it sells. The amount of money actually invested in
acquiring that physical property represents the measure of capital
on which it is morally entitled to earn interest and profit; and, in the
stage of promoting and financing the enterprise, all hope of earnings
is based on the amount of money required to construct the property.
These considerations lead the writer to contend that the true method
of valuing a corporate property is first to determine the cost of reproduction
of the property and its depreciation, and modify this figure
by any applicable positive or negative non-physical elements of value.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>The Michigan State Appraisals.</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c013'>Organization.</h3>

<p class='c014'>The State Legislature of Michigan, at the session of 1899, passed
an act creating a Board of State Tax Commissioners and outlining
and prescribing their duties. This act authorized the board to "inquire
into and ascertain the value of the property of corporations paying
specific taxes under any of the laws of this State."</p>

<p class='c000'>The object of this valuation was to determine the rate at which
the corporations were paying taxes, to the end that necessary laws
should be passed so that all taxable properties in the State might be
taxed uniformly.</p>

<p class='c000'>On September 1st, 1900, the Board of Tax Commissioners appointed
Professor Mortimer E. Cooley Appraiser of Properties. Immediately
thereafter the general organization was mapped out along the following
lines of division of labor and responsibility:</p>

<p class='c000'><em>1.—Administration.</em>—All matters of general policy in regard to
the conduct of the work, all matters relating to negotiations and
conferences with officials of corporations, all transactions with the
State Tax Commission, the Governor, or the Board of State Auditors,
and the entire direction of all relations with the public through
newspapers and other channels, were retained by the appraiser, who
was the final arbiter on all matters referred to him regarding the
details of the work.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>2.—Civil Engineering.</em>—The appraisal of all property which in
the course of construction would fall under the supervision of the civil
engineering department of a road, including land, roadway, bridges,
and structures, was in charge of the writer.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>3.—Mechanical Engineering.</em>—The appraisal of all motive power,
rolling stock, and property which in the course of construction would
fall under the supervision of the mechanical engineer, including power
and electric plants, shop tools and machinery, water stations, etc.,
was in charge of Mr. Theodore H. Hinchman, Jr., of Detroit, Mich.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the matter of the final assembling of figures, computation of percentage
values, and compilation of final results, Mr. Hinchman and
the writer worked together with joint general supervision.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>4.—Telegraphs.</em>—The inspection and appraisal of all telegraph
properties was under charge of Mr. William S. Conant, of Detroit,
Mich.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span><em>5.—Telephones.</em>—The appraisal of all telephone properties was
directed by Mr. William J. Rice, of New York.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>6.—Vessel Properties.</em>—All vessels belonging to companies whose
property was involved by the appraisal were inspected and appraised
by Herbert C. Sadler, Professor of Naval Architecture and Marine
Engineering at the University of Michigan.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the following narrative, no special mention is made of the
work executed under the direction of Messrs. Conant, Rice, and Sadler,
because they really had charge of independent appraisals which were
conducted on lines similar to those adopted in the railroad appraisal,
and their methods were not different from those of the latter; hence
any description of their work would be in a large measure repetition.
This omission is in no wise to be construed as any reflection on the
importance or high character of their work.</p>

<p class='c000'>The organization as just outlined, while necessarily touching and
overlapping at points, was generally defined so clearly that there was no
duplication of work. Each head of department was responsible for the
work of his special division, and directed the laying out and execution
of the work done by his men.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first task, after deciding on the general organization, was to
determine the general methods to be adopted and the manner of
getting the necessary detailed information. The magnitude of the
work was appalling. There were seventy-eight different incorporated
companies, owning some 10,000 miles of railroad, scattered over 54,000
sq. miles of territory. In addition, there were a number of small
unincorporated railroads, telegraph, telephone, plank road, and other
corporations, many of which had no records, no complete inventory,
and no department organized so that the information could be readily
secured. It was determined:</p>

<p class='c005'>(1) To make or secure a complete detailed inventory of every
piece or parcel of property belonging to each company;</p>

<p class='c005'>(2) To examine each separate thing, place on it an estimate of
cost of reproduction and depreciation;</p>

<p class='c005'>(3) To prepare, as a basis for the final figure of value, an estimate
of the present value, being the cost of reproduction less
the depreciation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having determined on a detailed physical inventory and appraisal,
the next step was to outline the work so as to secure absolute uniformity.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>The difficulties which confronted the appraiser at this period
were many, chief among which were:</p>

<p class='c000'>(a) <em>Lack of Complete Understanding on the Part of the State Officials.</em>—The
Governor and Board of Tax Commissioners rendered every
possible assistance, but the Board of State Auditors was not at first
fully committed to the work, and the uncertainty as to whether or
not bills would be paid, delayed seriously the employment of men and
the full commencement of work for 3 or 4 weeks after the first organization
was made.</p>

<p class='c000'>(b) <em>The Attitude of the Railroad Corporation Managers.</em>—While
this was not actively hostile, it was a serious cause of delay, as they
could not foresee what effect the work might have on the interests
in their charge, and, while not refusing access to their records, they
delayed and held back information; in fact, a long time elapsed
before all the companies opened their records to the appraiser and
his staff.</p>

<p class='c000'>(c) <em>The Confused Condition of the Records.</em> Many small corporations
had absolutely nothing in the way of records of buildings,
bridges, land, or other properties. Others had very complete records in
certain departments and very imperfect ones in others; still others had
records which had every appearance of being complete, but they were
not up-to-date.</p>

<p class='c000'>Facing an appraisal of this magnitude, with a time limit of only
4 months for the entire work, with delays at the outset which seriously
hampered the organization for 2 or 3 weeks, the appraiser was compelled
to occupy this time in preparing the blank forms to be used on
the work, and in conducting correspondence with the men who were
to make up the working force, investigating their references, etc.</p>

<p class='c000'>The blank forms, Figs. 1 to 10, were the result of a series of
conferences between the members of the staff. By this time it was
quite evident that no great amount of help could be hoped for from
the corporations. Had it been possible to secure access to the records
of such railroad companies as the Michigan Central or the Lake Shore
and Michigan Southern before the final drafts of the forms were
prepared, the writer believes that several might have been simplified and
many improvements could have been made. However, this was not
possible, and the forms were prepared and printed before access to
any railroad office had been granted.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>That a few changes were made in 1904 was to have been expected;
that these forms were almost in their entirety made a basis for the
similar work of the Wisconsin appraiser, some three years later, was
in the nature of a high compliment and goes far toward answering
the criticisms of this part of the work, generally to the effect that the
forms call for much more information than could possibly be used,
and that they show lack of care in arrangement.</p>

<p class='c000'>It may be said here, properly, that the uncertainty as to the final
attitude of the companies made it essential that the appraiser prepare,
if need be, to make his inventory by personal inspection in the field.
Indeed, this was done in the case of several roads, and, while most
of the companies finally accorded every courtesy, either giving the
appraiser access to their records, or furnishing the information desired,
it is not probable that the shortness of the time limit would have
enabled the appraiser to secure any sort of result had a modified plan
been adopted.</p>

<p class='c000'>The law provided no requirement that the companies should furnish
any information. In order to secure the data, it would have been
necessary to employ a large number of men, and this would have been
such a serious expense to the companies that refusal to comply
would probably have followed such a request. Many of the companies
had no men in their service able to prepare the required data; and,
finally, eight or ten men after having worked in the files of companies
owning reasonably full records, were much better able to take off
the desired data intelligently from the records of other companies than
men unfamiliar with the needs of the appraiser and with no prior
experience. Then, too, the work secured was that of one body of
technical men, all experienced in different phases of railway work, and
thus was uniform and consistent. Had seventy-five or eighty different
men or sets of men prepared these inventories, there would certainly
have been a great variation in their worth and reliability.</p>

<p class='c000'>It must be kept clearly in mind that lack of time was the main
feature which kept the appraiser from considering any such plan of co-operation
with the railroads as was adopted later in Wisconsin and
Minnesota, and that no distrust of the railroads, or lack of desire to
co-operate, had anything to do with the appraiser's decision to use
the method which was adopted.</p>

<p class='c000'>Shortly after the preparation of the blanks, access was granted to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>the records of the Ann Arbor Railroad, and almost immediately thereafter
several other companies opened their files to the appraiser; the
State Board of Auditors determined to pay the bills, as approved by
the appraiser; and the initial difficulties were so far removed that it
was possible to carry out, without any further delays, the plan of
organization which had been perfected.</p>

<p class='c000'>The personnel of the staff was considered to be of the greatest
importance, and, in the selection of men, the requirements desired
were: experience in the construction and operation of railroads,
thorough technical training, high standing in the Profession, as shown
by membership in the American Societies of Civil or Mechanical
Engineers, or of other Societies of high standing, and high moral
character. Politics, residence in the State, or local influence, had
absolutely no weight in the selection of any of the men. In a number
of cases men were secured who had for some years occupied the position
of Chief Engineer of important lines. In a very large number
of cases men who were engaged on this work have since its completion
held the position of Chief or Principal Assistant Engineer of important
railroads, and practically all of them returned to railway service.
Dozens of these men are well known, and their work deserves
that full credit should be given to each, but it is impossible to do
so within the limits of this paper.</p>

<p class='c000'>The minor positions, such as assistants in the field and in the
computing and compiling rooms, were assigned to younger men,
generally with some railroad experience, and in many cases they were
graduates of technical schools, Cornell, Yale, Rensselaer, Michigan,
Ohio State, and other schools having representatives.</p>

<p class='c000'>The writer believes that no more harmonious or loyal organization
was ever gathered together before, or has been since. Men who had
held Chief Engineer-ships trudged miles in the wilds of Michigan
on foot, inspecting and inventorying property, and came into the
office and worked long hours at the computing tables with the utmost
cheerfulness and <em>camaraderie</em>. There was complete harmony, absolute
loyalty, and as perfect a spirit of unselfish devotion to the work as
the writer has ever seen in any organization.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fact that such a staff of engineers, of wide experience in railroad
construction and maintenance, had been assembled, made it
feasible to carry out a plan of the appraiser which proved to be of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>great value. At frequent intervals, during the progress of the work,
conferences were held which were attended by all the heads of departments
and by many of the older and more experienced engineers.
Matters of policy, details, general principles, and rules and methods for
conducting the appraisal, were fully discussed, and stenographic records
were made of the discussion and conclusions. These conferences covered
practically every question that arose; they were of such a nature
as to draw out the opinions of the men fully and freely; and their
effect was to eliminate the error due to individual judgment, and
harmonize and unify the methods and results of the appraisal.</p>

<p class='c000'>Special emphasis has been laid on the organization of the staff,
because the criticism has been made that this work was lacking in
care, was hurriedly done, and was unreliable. The work must be judged
by its results, but the criticism that it did not receive proper care is
absolutely unjustified in fact. The men engaged were of the highest
type of experienced, technically educated, and highly qualified engineers;
they entered the work unreservedly, and gave the best there
was in them. The Michigan appraisal was not a one-man job; it was
the work of many men, and all are entitled to credit.</p>

<p class='c000'>That some men in an organization such as this, gathered from
all over the United States, should prove to be lacking, and should
fail to hold their place with their fellows, was to have been expected.
That the number of such men should not exceed half a dozen was
remarkable. In fact, almost every such case was found when the
first notes were returned to the office, and in only two or three
instances was it necessary to send a second man to do work which had
been once covered. In several cases men were sent over certain sections
which had been inspected by some one else, with a view of getting
an idea of the personal judgment of the different men, but in such
cases the results were astonishingly close, and created the greatest confidence
in the figures of depreciation which were being received.</p>

<p class='c000'>Looking back on this work, after the lapse of 10 years, after having
fully reviewed it twice, and examined all records, after having heard
the men engaged on it testify in court, and knowing the record of these
men since the completion of the work, the writer believes himself fully
justified in stating that, no matter what opinion may be held as to
the accuracy, reliability, or value of the result, no charge of carelessness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>neglect, undue haste, or lack of consideration can be sustained
as against the staff.</p>

<p class='c000'>To strengthen the work further, to eliminate the element of personal
error, to guard against the danger of dulled perceptions due to
constant application to the work, and to forestall, if possible, every
point of objection to methods, a Board of Review was chosen by
Appraiser Cooley to whom were referred:</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>a</em>) The methods of inventory and valuation, as determined by
the staff;</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>b</em>) All points on which special discussion or difference of opinion
were noted in the working conferences;</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>c</em>) Questions as to elements of value in the physical property
which were in themselves not tangible or capable of inventory;
and finally,</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>d</em>) The results of the whole work.</p>

<p class='c000'>The members of this board were chosen on account of pre-eminent
standing in the Profession, and on account of experience and prominence
in railway engineering. The board was composed of four men,
as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>Chairman, Octave Chanute, Past-President, Am. Soc. C. E., former
Consulting Engineer, Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railway, but
at the time not engaged in active railway work.</p>

<p class='c000'>George W. Vaughn, M. Am. Soc. C. E., Engineer in charge of
Track Elevation in Chicago.</p>

<p class='c000'>Charles E. Greene, M. Am. Soc. C. E., Dean of the School of
Engineering, University of Michigan.</p>

<p class='c000'>Charles Hansel, M. Am. Soc. C. E., former Engineer, Wabash Railroad,
former Chief Engineer, Illinois Railway and Warehouse Commission,
and at that time General Manager of the National Switch
and Signal Company.</p>

<p class='c000'>These gentlemen were not engaged in any detailed work on the
appraisal; they came to the work for one week each month with minds
entirely clear of all confusion raised by issues of detail, and were
thus enabled to pass as a court upon all matters laid before them.
Their association was of inestimable value in giving confidence to
the members of the staff. The many years of railway service of
Messrs. Chanute and Vaughn, and their unquestioned ability in that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>special field of engineering, gave the stamp of finality to points
decided by them. The special knowledge of Mr. Hansel in the field
of signal engineering, and his known ability as an expert in organization
and administration, were of the greatest value. The service of
Professor Greene was that of the analyst and logician; his clear and
judicial mind enabled him to formulate the final arguments in many
cases under consideration.</p>

<p class='c000'>The writer wishes to make it perfectly clear that he has not
attempted to minimize the work of Professor Cooley by stating the
exact relation of the many engineers on the staff to this work, but
to bring out and emphasize the fact that no one man, or no two or
three men, were responsible for any single part, but that the whole
represents the best efforts of sixty or seventy experienced men working
to secure a fair, honest, unprejudiced, engineering estimate along
such lines as would eliminate, as far as possible, all errors of individual
judgment.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has never been claimed for the work that it was perfect, or that
it was entirely free from errors. It has been and is claimed for it that
it probably represents as close and conservative an estimate of cost of
reproduction and depreciation as it would be possible for any set of
men to make under the conditions then existing.</p>

<p class='c000'>Professor Cooley was in constant touch with the work, knew its
every detail, passed upon and approved every rule and order, presided
at every conference, and nothing more than his activity, optimism, and
constant watchful care and tireless energy kept the force at work
day and night and brought about the prompt completion of the details.
His recognized high standing, his remarkable ability as an executive
and organizer, and his powers of diplomacy, more than anything else,
brought about the final acquiescence of the railroad managers and kept
up the confidence of the State authorities; his personality pervades the
entire work. After giving all due credit to the staff, and they were
entitled to much credit, the real honor must go to Professor Cooley.
It was his conception, his plan, and the brunt of the battle was his.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>Office and Field Methods.</h3>

<p class='c014'>The preliminaries of the organization having been completed, and
the forms prepared, a portion of the working force was brought on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>the ground, and the work was actively commenced. It was subdivided
into four parts:</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>1</em>) Office inspection, or inventory;</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>2</em>) Field inspection;</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>3</em>) Computation;</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>4</em>) Compilation for the permanent record.</p>

<p class='c000'>The men chosen as field inspectors were old and experienced railroad
engineers. As far as possible, they were assigned for a short
period to office inspection, then they were sent into the field, after
which they worked at the computation of values; so that each man
was engaged on many different phases of the work, and handled the
notes of many of his fellows, and no one man made up one complete
appraisal, except as specially noted.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Making the Inventories.</em>—Office inspection, or the preparation of
inventories, was assigned to parties usually of one or two experienced
men with from two to four younger engineers as assistants in the
computing-room. These men went to the general offices of the railroad
companies and made a complete examination of maps, profiles,
bridge and building records, records of motive power, rolling stock, etc.
In short, they prepared, as far as it was possible to do so, a complete
inventory of every building, structure, or piece of property owned
by the road; they took off complete abstracts of real estate and right-of-way
records; they noted principal yards and terminals, and secured
maps of such as were most complex, or furnished lists of such maps
and records as were most essential for the field men, and they made
as complete a report as possible of the corporate history of the road
and the general condition of its engineering records. No effort whatever
was made to examine or audit the financial books of any company,
or to secure from such books any data as to cost of property;
the work was entirely limited to the listing of physical property.</p>

<p class='c000'>Most of the railroad companies co-operated, and gave access to
their records; one or two filled in the forms; a number had practically
no records, and only one or two companies withheld information.
Requests for blue prints of large yards and terminals, and of plans
of standard structures were generally granted cheerfully, and, although
there was no such spirit of co-operation as was shown later by the
Wisconsin roads, much labor was saved by the data furnished.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>The result of the office inspection was the filing of inventories,
which were generally quite complete, the securing of maps and plans,
the gathering of data as to prevailing prices of labor and material,
and the securing of some very valuable cost data as to special structures
and classes of structures. All inventories were made up for
roads, or for divisions of roads, with each class of property listed
separately, for example, station buildings, interlocking plants, bridges,
etc., so that, if necessary, any special class of inspection might be
assigned to one man, while to others could be assigned the remainder
of the work on that particular road or division.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Office Inspection as a Check on Field Work.</em>—The office inspection
furnished many valuable data for checking the judgment of the field
men. For example, the number of cubic yards of excavation and
embankment on probably the greater part of the mileage had to be
secured by the field inspectors, either because the records had not
been kept or the changes of line and grade had been so extensive as
to destroy their reliability. Every field inspector, therefore, made
his own estimate of the yardage of pay earth. The office inspection
reports, however, gave reliable data (from profiles or original contract
estimate files) of the actual yardage on possibly 2000 or 3000 miles
of line, so widely scattered that it constituted a check on the work of
a majority of the field men.</p>

<p class='c000'>This work of office inspection disclosed the following points, which
will be practically common to all large valuation jobs:</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>a</em>) There was no uniformity of method in the keeping of records
of permanent way and structures;</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>b</em>) There was a vast amount of carelessness in keeping records
up to date, even on the larger roads;</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>c</em>) The smaller roads, not only had little or nothing in the way
of records, but had in many cases no department with
employees qualified to make or keep such records;</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>d</em>) The purchase of new equipment, the construction of new
buildings and bridges, and the destruction, sale, or removal
of old property, create a condition of continuous change
which is seldom recorded by either operating or accounting
officials, and makes book inventories derived from the roads
of very doubtful value for use in an appraisal.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span><em>Field Inspection.</em>—The decision had been reached, after careful discussion,
not to permit the field inspectors to place a money value on
any structure, but to examine it, make a full description of it in all
particulars, and assign to it a percentage which should represent the
present value, or the depreciation from a similar new structure rated
at 100 per cent.</p>

<p class='c000'>The field inspectors were furnished with the records of the office
inspection covering the district assigned. They were given notebooks,
tape lines, and various blanks for reporting progress and recording
original estimates in the field. Provision was made for inspection
by the field men, either by the use of hand-cars, gasoline inspection
cars, or velocipede cars, although, with one or two of the roads, no
satisfactory arrangement could be made, and the men were compelled
to go on foot. A careful inspection of every structure was made.
If any correction to the office inspection record was necessary, it was
made; if the structure was new, it was carefully measured and
described, and everything noted which would be of service in estimating
its value. Side-tracks were measured, and the weight and type
of rail noted. All culverts and bridges were examined, described, and
their condition noted. Estimates were made of excavation and embankment,
clearing and grubbing, etc. (based on the standing timber at
the time of the examination), and careful estimates were made of classifications
of material. The records of the field inspector generally contained
only the description and the percentage, but, occasionally,
when apparently valuable information as to cost of any particular
structure was available it was noted, as was special information of
local matters affecting the value of any part of the work.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was the plan (carried out with but few exceptions) to complete
the record with the field inspector so that from his notes a full and
accurate descriptive inventory might be made. There were a few
exceptions to the general method of field inspection work as outlined,
which were:</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Special Work on the Chicago and Northwestern Railway.</em>—The
Chicago and Northwestern Railway had no records of any sort, all
construction papers having been destroyed by fire. This company
organized and placed in the field four complete engineering parties,
each under one of its own engineers, and with each party was sent
one field inspector. The line was carefully surveyed and cross-sectioned,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>and complete records of every building and structure were
made, side-tracks were measured, and data taken for rail and ballast
charts, etc. All work was done in the presence of the field inspector,
and he was given copies of all notes. He placed his own percentage
of depreciation on everything. The estimates, made up independently
by the Chicago and Northwestern engineers and the appraisal staff,
using in the latter case the same unit prices as applied elsewhere in
the Upper Peninsula, varied less than 2 per cent.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Special Valuations.</em>—Certain special structures, such as ore docks
and ore and coal handling machinery, were of such a character as to
require expert appraisal. These were examined in the field, appraised,
and valued by G. H. Hutchinson, M. Am. Soc. C. E., whose special
training and experience in such work had qualified him perhaps better
than any other man. Interlocking and signaling plants were specially
appraised by the late Elliot F. Moore, who for 10 years had been
Engineer of the Michigan Railroad Commission, and whose intimate
personal knowledge of almost every plant in the State specially qualified
him for this work.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some of the bridges were of such a character as to require expert
knowledge, and this inspection was assigned to William Dunbar
Jenkins, M. Am. Soc. C. E., a man of ripe experience and sound
judgment. The larger and more elaborate station buildings were
examined and appraised, and values finally placed by Mr. F. G.
Susemihl, Chief Architect of the Michigan Central System, whose
special work in railway buildings made him thoroughly familiar with
these values.</p>

<p class='c000'>Work equipment and special equipment were appraised by Mr.
G. L. Lewis, who had been connected with the Marion Steam Shovel
Company for many years.</p>

<p class='c000'>Except for these special assignments, all the field inspection was
handled in accordance with the appraiser's plan.</p>

<p class='c000'>As stated previously, in only two or three cases was it necessary to
re-inspect, and, while several sections were intentionally gone over a
second time, without letting the field inspector know who had done
the work previously, or what his percentages had been, the result of
all these checks was to justify the figures in the earlier inspection
and to strengthen confidence in the work.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>The field inspection of the Mechanical Department involved examining
and placing a percentage value on each locomotive, passenger
car, and piece of special equipment, and on all shop machinery. Inasmuch
as several points of special interest are involved in this inspection,
it will be discussed at more length in the section of the paper
relating to the methods of work of the Mechanical Department.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Computation.</em>—After the completion of the field inspection, all
notes were placed in the hands of the computing force. This organization
consisted of two classes of men, engineers brought in from field
inspection, and younger engineers. All computations were made independently
by two men, and all work was checked carefully.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every man in the computing room was furnished a large bound
blank-book, in which he was required to make all his notes and computations,
no figures of any sort being made on loose paper. The
name of each man was placed on his notebook, and each set of field
and office inspection notes worked upon by him was signed with his
initials. It was easy to trace the work of every man, and in the
subsequent trial of the Tax Cases, every man in the service returned,
and, not only testified as to his office and field inspection, but was able
to turn to and identify all the computations made by him, and produce
his original figures and memoranda.</p>

<p class='c000'>Very soon it became evident that such a volume of reports, notebooks,
memoranda, maps, plans, pamphlets, and other data was being
accumulated that, unless a special system was developed for filing and
handling in the office, the confusion would be serious and costly.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Filing in Office.</em>—The system of filing and record keeping had the
merit of being simple and inexpensive. There was borne in mind,
in devising this plan, the necessity of keeping all papers connected
with one division of any road together, the need for reducing to a
minimum the labor of filing and indexing, the constant use of papers,
and their frequent withdrawal from the files, making it necessary
that they could be at once located when they were not in the files.</p>

<p class='c000'>The vault in the appraisers' office was arranged so that large
manilla envelopes, each of sufficient size to hold all the reports, notes,
maps, etc., of each road or division, could be filed vertically. Each
road was given a number; if there were several divisions, each division
was given a letter, as "15-<em>A</em>," "15-<em>B</em>," etc., and each division was filed
separately.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>Every report, book, map, or other paper was stamped with its road
or division number and letter, and given a sheet number. In this
manner every paper was identified, and could be at once placed.
A record was kept in a book, describing every paper filed in each
envelope.</p>

<p class='c000'>In issuing papers for work, the entire file was taken and kept
together at all times.</p>

<p class='c000'>One man had charge of the filing and recording, and no one else
was permitted to enter the vault. When a file was withdrawn, a receipt
was taken, and was put in the place of this file; and when the
papers were restored to the vault the receipt was destroyed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The system proved adequate, and was much less cumbersome than
a more elaborate system of card indexing of separate papers could
possibly have been.</p>

<p class='c000'>The net result of office and field inspection had been an inventory
based on the railroad records, checked by a man in the field, with a
percentage representing the field inspector's judgment as to depreciation,
together with a considerable number of special data as to original
cost, etc. It was now necessary to place figures of estimated cost of
reproduction and depreciation in terms of money.</p>

<p class='c000'>The State of Michigan is made up of two peninsulas, widely separated,
with radically different conditions prevailing as to certain
items of the cost of construction.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Computation Tables.</em>—This appraisal involved seventy-eight incorporated
and forty-seven unincorporated railroads. It was necessary
to adopt such a system as would apply uniform methods and prices
to all like property. Accordingly, the field inspectors were assembled,
and, after conference, it was determined to prepare a set of tables,
covering all classes of railway construction, material, and structures,
values being computed for 100% value, and for each 10% depreciation.
These tables covered different weights, sizes, and types of structures
and material, and were all computed on the basis of the agreed
estimated cost.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Unit Prices.</em>—The unit prices were the result of a most careful
study and discussion. For many items, such as clearing, grubbing,
earthwork, masonry, etc., the price was fixed by agreement during the
discussion at a figure which represented the fair average cost of this
particular item during the 5-year period preceding the appraisal.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>For rails and rail structures, an average price was secured from
market quotations for a period of 10 years, a price was determined as
the value of scrap, and the percentage of depreciation was applied to the
wearing value of the rail. The unit price was $28; the agreed scrap
value was $12, leaving $16 as the wearing value of the rail. If an
inspector reported rail at 90%, or at 30%, this percentage was taken
from the $16 wearing value and to this was added the scrap value.
The tables were arranged so that, for any weight of rail and any percentage,
the cost of reproduction and the present value could be taken
from the tables in dollars per mile. The same was true of bolts,
spikes, angle-bars, fish-plates, and frogs and switches.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the case of material such as ties, where no scrap value could
be attached, the percentage was applied directly to the first cost.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the case of bridges, the tables gave weights per foot and per
span for various lengths, types of structures, and loadings, and only
the cost of reproduction was estimated.</p>

<p class='c000'>Estimated costs per cubic foot were deduced for buildings of various
standard railroad types and per square foot for depot platforms.
These figures were obtained by reducing to this basis the cost of a
large number of buildings of known cost, by comparison with data
obtained from railroad companies and from a number of engineers
who had kept such records, and by consultation with architects. These
building tables did not apply to the more elaborate and costly structures,
all of which were appraised specially.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ballasting, track laying, and surfacing were divided into three
and four classes, in order to cover the different general types of railroads,
and prices per mile were fixed. On Upper Peninsula roads
ballasting was estimated at a higher price than on Lower Peninsula
roads, while ties and timber construction were estimated at a lower
figure.</p>

<p class='c000'>In addition to these prices, secured by averaging several years'
quotations, or by agreement of experienced construction engineers,
many valuable figures were obtained from manufacturers of locomotives,
cars, mechanical equipment, and bridges; and in several
cases access was given to the mechanical cost data of the larger roads.
Specifications for locomotives, cars, and shop tools were sent out to
builders with a request that they give average prices for a period of
years.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>From all this mass of data the unit prices for the valuation were
determined. For locomotives, values were plotted for engines of
different weights, in order to establish a curve, and curves representing
deterioration, scrap value, and major repairs were also plotted, so as
to ascertain diagrammatically the value of an engine of given weight
and stated condition.</p>

<p class='c000'>The tables and diagrams proved of incalculable benefit in reducing
the work, and in securing that absolute uniformity of method necessary
to give the appraisal standing.</p>

<p class='c000'>It may not be amiss to state here that in such a work no set of
unit prices could possibly be adopted which would not work some
apparent injustice. A number of Michigan lumber roads were of
the cheapest possible type of construction, and any unit price applied
to ties or timber, which would be at all reasonable for such roads as
the Michigan Central, Grand Rapids and Indiana, Pere Marquette,
and others, would be far in excess of the actual money paid out by
these little roads. A few individual instances of such apparent discrepancy
were cause of complaint and criticism, but, on analysis, very
generally, these did not appear to be anything but a disagreement with
book values, in which ties cut off the right of way were treated as
having no cost; or in some similar item certain local conditions may
have made the first cost so low as to amount to a donation of property.
Conceding the propriety of the objections, the reason for making
the appraisal was to furnish information on which the legislature
might determine whether the State should go from a specific to an
ad valorem basis, and in view of this purpose the objections became
unimportant, as they applied to but a few miles of road.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Classification.</em>—All work of computation was classified in strict
accordance with the Interstate Commerce Commission's classification
of construction accounts, to which were added one or two classifications
not recognized by that Commission, and final summaries were
returned on sheets similar to those illustrated by Figs. 1 to 10.</p>

<p class='c000'>In computing, the staff made use of all data of every nature which
was before them, checked the judgment of the field inspector wherever
any reliable data were furnished, took into account age, special notes,
or costs, and, in case of any serious discrepancy in his percentage,
reported to the head of the department for either a re-inspection or
for a conference with the appraiser and inspector. In this department
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>every possible safeguard was thrown around the work to insure
its absolute mathematical correctness, and to guard against errors
in the personal equation.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Compilation.</em>—After the calculations were checked and completed
they passed to the compilers, who arranged and classified them, and
prepared the form of the final report. This consisted of a detailed
list of every piece of property and every structure, with a short description
and specification, and a statement of estimated cost of reproduction
and present value. The division is made by roads, by divisions
of roads, and by counties. This was done after the completion
of all other work, and the disbanding of the organization, a small
force being retained by the State to compile and put in permanent
form all the papers of the appraisal. This work was done under the
direction of Messrs. James Walker and O. C. Le Suer in consultation
with Professor Cooley.</p>

<p class='c000'>The final compilations were typewritten on large sheets and bound,
and constitute the final record of the physical valuation. After the
completion of the 1900 appraisal, all papers connected with the work
of the computing office were arranged in proper order and bound.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>Special Problems of the Mechanical Department.</h3>

<p class='c014'>The Civil Engineering section dealt wholly with fixed property
located entirely within the State; and the work offered no special
difficulties in the way of assignment of values. It is true that, when
the question of terminal values was under discussion, the Wisconsin
and Michigan Railroad offered a very pretty example, in that the
revenue-producing half of its mileage lay in Michigan, while its shops,
yards, docks, and car ferries, comprising the great bulk of its physical
property, were in Wisconsin. This instance merely emphasized the
fact that no State valuation of an interstate property can settle finally
and definitely all the questions that arise.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Assignment of Value to States.</em>—The Mechanical Department was
compelled to handle the valuation of moving property, and to assign
values as between the States on such a basis as would be fair to all
parties. The Courts have been inclined to view the distribution of
values between territorial units on the track-mileage basis as being
a fair one. The study of the problem in Michigan indicates that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>while this method, perhaps, is just in most cases, it will not hold in
all. Assignment was made upon several bases, as follows:</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>a</em>) Main-line mileage;</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>b</em>) Total track-mileage;</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>c</em>) Car- and locomotive-mileage of equipment operating in Michigan;</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>d</em>) Car- and locomotive-mileage, entire equipment;</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>e</em>) Freight-car mileage of the entire system.</p>

<p class='c000'>The results secured by these different methods show, in many cases,
very little difference; all are close, and no injustice is worked by any
method, while, in other cases, the figures are widely divergent.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway owns a high-class
main line between Chicago and Buffalo, and for part of the way
there are two lines several miles apart; the entire line is double-tracked,
and there is much third track. None of this line is located
in Michigan, except some 80 miles of single-track main line of the
Michigan Division between Toledo and Elkhart. The company, however,
has several hundred miles of branch line in Michigan, which
comprises most of the branch-line mileage of its system. These lines,
generally, are far inferior to its main line.</p>

<p class='c000'>Any apportionment of its equipment between States on the basis
of either line-mileage, total track-mileage, or locomotive- and equipment-mileage
of total equipment will result in the assignment to
Michigan of a value far in excess of a proper or fair amount. An
apportionment of locomotive and passenger-car equipment on the
basis of equipment-mileage or equipment operating in the State, and
for freight cars on the basis of car-mileage of total equipment, was
found to be most fair.</p>

<p class='c000'>In making the assignment of values, this study was made for all
interstate roads, and such basis used as was apparently most fair in
each case, the department making a special effort not to assign to
Michigan undue values or those which could not be sustained.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Freight Car Inspection.</em>—One of the most perplexing problems
which was faced by the Mechanical Department was the proper and
satisfactory inspection and valuation of freight equipment. The
freight cars owned by the companies were scattered over the United
States and Canada, and the inspection of any considerable percentage
of those owned by any company was, of course, an impossibility.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>The fact that these cars had been purchased in series, so that there
were considerable numbers in a group, all of the same age, and built
according to the same specifications, made possible a valuation by
groups. The acceptance, however, of any arbitrary percentage of
depreciation by years, or the acceptance of the rules of depreciation
of the Master Car Builders Association, without making independent
investigation with a view of establishing the correctness of the rule,
appeared to be unwise.</p>

<p class='c000'>The several companies submitted carefully prepared statements
of equipment. These statements were compared with the equipment
register and the reports to the Commissioner of Railroads. The prices
used were those of the rules of interchange of the Master Car Builders
Association wherever applicable.</p>

<p class='c000'>Prices were furnished by the leading manufacturers, and in many
cases were secured from the books of the railroad company.</p>

<p class='c000'>In order to determine the condition of the equipment, the inspectors
of the department personally examined 32,000 freight cars in
Michigan and adjoining States. Their reports were separated, classified,
and analyzed by groups, with the result that the inspection fully
confirmed and justified the use of the rule for depreciation of the
Master Car Builders Association, which was therefore applied. In
the 1902 appraisal this rule was accepted without any inspection or
further study of the problem.</p>

<p class='c000'>The criticism of this part of the work by the appraiser of the
State of Washington is wholly unjustified, as the work was necessary
in order to qualify in Court and defend the rule adopted, and the actual
cost of the work was small.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Locomotives.</em>—The inventory of locomotive equipment was secured
from the companies, and checked against reports and the equipment
register. Personal inspection was made of every locomotive in the
State, then a complete description was prepared, and the percentage of
depreciation assigned. Curves of depreciation had been computed and
plotted, and the figures of the inspectors were compared carefully with
the curve in order to eliminate possible errors.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Vessels.</em>—Professor Sadler's appraisal of vessels involved a personal
examination of every vessel. This survey included:</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>a</em>) The hull of the vessel and general equipment;</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>b</em>) The machinery and boilers.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>An independent estimate of the cost of reproduction and depreciation
was made, and, wherever possible, this was checked by comparison
with the detailed original cost. In case of material difference, various
shipbuilders were consulted, and independent estimates of cost were
secured. In every case these latter estimates were confirmatory of the
estimated cost of reproduction, which figures were used throughout
the appraisal.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>Overhead Charges.</h3>

<p class='c014'>There are certain expenses connected inseparably with the construction
of any public work, which, on the completion of that work,
are not capable of physical identification, but which, nevertheless, belong
to and must be a part of the cost of the physical property. These
expenses are legitimate; and, as long as the property is operated, a
very large part, if not all, of the entire expense remains in the present
value of the property as a "going concern."</p>

<p class='c000'>Appraiser Cooley and his staff took up the discussion of these items
and disposed of those which were carried into the valuation by the
placing of a percentage. These items are:</p>

<p class='c005'><em>Engineering.</em>—This covered all the cost of preliminary and location
surveys, design, and supervision of construction of the
work, and all expenses connected therewith. This was covered
by a charge of 4% of the cost of reproducing the permanent
way and structure, but not the equipment.</p>

<p class='c005'><em>Legal Expense.</em>—This item is inseparable from the construction
work, and was fixed at one-half of 1% of the cost of the same
items as affected by the engineering charge.</p>

<p class='c005'><em>Organization Expense.</em>—This covered the cost of promotion,
financing, and general supervision of construction, together
with general office expense. These items were covered by an
application of 1½% of the cost of the above items.</p>

<p class='c005'><em>Interest.</em>—This item is intended to cover interest on money during
the period of construction. The length of time taken to
build would, of course, be variable. It was assumed that
3% on the entire cost of construction and equipment would
be conservative, and this figure was used.</p>

<p class='c005'><em>Discount on Bonds.</em>—This was not included, for the reason that
it was considered, not as a proper capital charge, but rather
as an adjustment of the interest rate to the existing market
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>condition, and as chargeable to interest account and not
capital.</p>

<p class='c000'>The discussion among members of the staff indicated such a wide
range of opinion as to the proper percentages to apply, that the final
determination of the rates was passed upon by the Board of Review.
There can be no question as to the propriety of these items as proper
elements in the first cost of construction of a new railroad. On the
theory that the cost of reproduction of the physical property should
include every item of expense which would enter into the cost of
reproducing the property as it existed on the date of the appraisal,
they are proper terms to include in the appraisal. As to whether the
fixed rates were high enough in every case, is an open question.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>The Charge of Ten Per Cent. for Contingencies.</em>—Perhaps no single
feature of the Michigan appraisal of physical property has been so
generally criticised as the charge of 10% of the entire estimated cost,
including all the percentage charges, to cover "contingencies."</p>

<p class='c000'>At the time the first appraisal was made, the writer was not at
all satisfied that such an item, in such amount, should be included.
The reasons advanced were so strong that it was done, and the writer's
subsequent work has fully convinced him that it was proper and justifiable,
because:</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>a</em>) The conditions under which this particular inventory and
appraisal were made, as to time and lack of co-operation of
the companies, made it practically certain that some items
of value were missed in the appraisal, such as station and
miscellaneous equipment, frogs, switches, track structures,
buildings owned by the companies and occupied by others, etc.</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>b</em>) That there were many and large elements of physical cost not
ascertainable by a physical inspection, such as deep foundations,
many thousands of yards of earth in swamps and sink
holes (a very general condition of roads in the Southern
Peninsula), concealed classification due to growth of grass
or washing of banks, and many other cases of work actually
done, invisible after a lapse of years. The writer knows of
many such instances on property which was in his charge
many years ago; in several cases there were expenditures of
from
0,000 to $50,000 which are now entirely invisible to
an engineer passing over the line.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>(<em>c</em>) The failure on the part of railroad companies to keep anything
like a complete history of construction operations, and
the changes of operating officials from year to year, cause
the loss of record of practically all the expense due to extra
hazard and risk which the construction engineer provides
for by his "contingencies."</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>d</em>) The inclusion in operating expense, every year, of sums which
are properly construction, and which, if added to unit prices
of construction work, would cause the cry that such unit
prices were too high. For instance, the appraisal estimate
on earth was 17 cents per cu. yd., with no allowance for overhaul.
Very much of the grade in the State had actual costs
far in excess of this figure, and practically every road spends
a large sum annually for the first four or five years, which
is charged to operation but is in reality a part of the cost of
completing the roadbed.</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>e</em>) No account was taken of appreciation of any of the elements
entering into a road. There is no doubt that roadbed, for
example, does appreciate, due to ballasting and track work.
These items go far toward accounting for the contingencies
item on an old road such as the Michigan Central.</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>f</em>) There is a considerable amount of cost, which cannot be taken
out of capital, where facilities are abandoned or line or grade
changed. These changes are common to all growing roads;
they are due to the demands for greater traffic; they are necessary
to the welfare of the community served; they are often
made at points where no charge of defective design will apply.
They might be termed expenses due to the development of
the State, and, in the development of the railroad business,
they were absolutely necessary for its present standard of
efficiency. They are incapable of exact and definite determination,
and must of necessity be included as contingent expenses.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the case of a new road, where the exact cost is ascertainable, the
records have been fully kept, the original plans are on file, and the
history is fresh in the minds of the officials, it will be readily admitted
that a charge for contingencies in large amount would not be justifiable;
but, in the case of the Michigan Central Railroad, a line more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>than 50 years old, which has changed, rebuilt, and added largely to its
property; in the case of the Pere Marquette Railroad, made up of the
union of a dozen lesser properties, without any complete history; in
the case of dozens of little lines, without maps, profiles, or records,
some such allowance is fully justified and proper.</p>

<p class='c000'>The experience of the writer, in the years that have passed since
these appraisals, leads him to the opinion that the difficulty of estimating
values on an old property are such that in many cases an appraiser
might add, with perfect propriety, even more than 10% for the
contingency item.</p>

<p class='c000'>In computing overhead charges, no allowance was made for working
capital, and no addition to the physical valuation was made to
cover any such element as "going concern" value.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>Right-of-Way Values.</h3>

<p class='c014'>Land values were the subject of a great deal of discussion during
the appraisal of 1900, but subsequent investigations as to actual railroad
purchases resulted in quite radical changes in some of the figures
in the later valuations. In view of the fact that many criticisms of
these values have been made by railway attorneys, special emphasis
is here given to the subject. The conclusions reached in Michigan
in 1902 agree so closely with the conclusions of Taylor in Wisconsin
and Morgan in Minnesota that it is thought advisable to give a rather
full account of the methods used in both appraisals, and the line of
reasoning which brought about the changes made in 1902.</p>

<p class='c000'>The 1900 appraisals methods were as follows: Work in Detroit,
Grand Rapids, Saginaw, Bay City, and some other large cities was
assigned to special appraisers, who visited the cities, examined critically
all the property, conferred with leading real estate men and experts
in values, and placed an estimate per acre or per square foot. This
part of the work was done with great care, and was substantially unchanged
in the later appraisals.</p>

<p class='c000'>In all other land valuations, in cities and villages, and country right
of way, a personal examination was out of the question without making
a very large and expensive addition to the staff, as the field engineers
generally were not familiar with realty values, and could not
take the time to make the large number of inquiries. The appraiser
did not see his way clear to organize a special department, therefore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>the matter was turned over to a sub-department of the Civil Engineering
Section, the work of which may be briefly outlined, as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>Lands were classified as:</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>1</em>) Farm land,</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>2</em>) Barren land,</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>3</em>) Villages having a population of less than 500,</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>4</em>) Villages from 500 to 3,000,</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>5</em>) Cities having less than 10,000,</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>6</em>) Cities having more than 10,000.</p>

<p class='c000'>The percentage of waste land was fixed as a result of interviews with
roadmasters, superintendents, and other officials and employees of the
roads, by reports from field inspectors and others.</p>

<p class='c000'>Letters of inquiry were sent to real estate men and bankers in
every county in the State (some 500 being communicated with), as to
land values in the town or county of each. The responses, which
were numerous and indicated considerable care in preparation, were
classified, and on these data, supplemented by as much personal inspection
as it was possible for a few men to give in a limited time, the
values of the various classes of land were determined by a system of
averages. The naked land values were then taken, and to them were
added, as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>South of a line east and west through Saginaw, 125% plus a fixed
charge varying from $8.50 per acre downward was added to the so-called
naked land values for farm land. No waste land values were
considered in this district. North of this east and west line: Farm
land, 100% and a fixed charge of $3 per acre and upward; waste land,
200% plus a fixed charge of $3 per acre; for all village lands, 125%
plus $8.50, fixed charge; for all city lands, 100% plus $8.50, fixed
charge.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fixed charges were intended to cover the expense of acquiring
abstracts, recording deeds, etc. Slightly different figures were made
for the Upper Peninsula.</p>

<p class='c000'>The result of this work was a set of very low figures in many counties,
the average price per acre hardly reaching the going price of improved
farm lands. There was so little time to review these figures
after they were in shape that they were used in 1900, although the
appraiser was convinced that they were generally too low.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>In the appraisal of 1902 a very careful study of real estate values
was made. The offices of Registers of Deeds in ten or twelve counties
were visited, a careful abstract of all railway transfers for a period
of 10 years was taken off, the acreage determined, the average price per
acre for different classes of land computed, and then a very careful
study of transfers of adjacent improved and unimproved lands was
made. As a result, material increases were made in the farm land
values, waste land values were eliminated, the 1900 valuation, made by
special appraisers in large cities, was practically unchanged, while
very radical changes in the way of equalization of values of lands
in villages and small cities were made.</p>

<p class='c000'>Inasmuch as the 1902 valuation was at issue in the Courts, the
writer believes he is justified in discussing at some length the deduction
of the staff on the conclusion of the 1902 preliminary studies,
which led to the final adoption of the new figures.</p>

<p class='c000'>One would fall into error if country values for farm purposes were
conflicted with country values for railroad purposes. There is, undoubtedly,
a close relationship between the two classes of values; this
the writer has endeavored to discover, and it is indicated in Tables
2 to 6. The use to which land is put can and does change its value.
Farm land in a certain township may be worth $50 per acre for farming,
but the discovery of oil would affect values, as far as oil purposes
are concerned. The presence of a vein of coal would give a distinct
value for mining purposes. Farm prices would not govern values for
any special use, such as oil drilling, mining, or railroad operation.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the case of city business property, farm prices cannot be applied,
as the use to which the land is put and the buildings placed on it
give it a greatly increased earning power, and hence increased value.
Thus, with a railroad right of way, the continuity of the strip of land,
the severance of lands crossed by it, the greater earning power it derives
from the construction placed on it, in short, the uses to which
it is put, give it a value far in excess of adjoining lands. An excellent
proof of this is found in the fact that many thousands of miles of right
of way have been bought by promoters and either sold to a company,
which built the lines, or used in financing the road. In no case has
the selling price been based on farm values.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is not contended that railroad land values do not bear a direct
relation to land values for other purposes, as those things which tend to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>increase general values usually make the construction of a railroad
profitable, and the better and more fully developed the country, the
greater is the need for transportation facilities and the higher the
prices of land for all purposes. This is shown in the figures submitted
herewith.</p>

<p class='c000'>For purposes of appraisal, therefore, in 1902 the average value, as
derived from the 1900 appraisal, was taken, and, by comparison with
actual purchases, an attempt was made to ascertain the relation existing
between the appraisal figures of 1900 and the usual purchase price
for railroad properties, as determined by actual transfers. In making
these figures the appraiser was forced to the following conclusions:</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>1</em>) That the naked land value is not a proper one to use in country
lands, but that the going value of country lands with all
improvements should be used as a basis for computing the
added increment due to railway use;</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>2</em>) That a classification of farm land and waste land should not
be made, except as a basis for arriving at the relative differences
in quality of land in different sections of a county;</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>3</em>) That the added value for railroad purposes is due to the three
elements:</p>

<p class='c015'>(<em>a</em>) Continuity,</p>

<p class='c015'>(<em>b</em>) Severance or damages,</p>

<p class='c015'>(<em>c</em>) Changed earning power,</p>

<p class='c016'>all of which the farmer or owner has cognizance of in making
his price;</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>4</em>) That in making up land values, account should be taken of:</p>

<p class='c015'>(<em>a</em>) The cost of acquiring the land, or expense,</p>

<p class='c015'>(<em>b</em>) The cost of the land itself.</p>

<p class='c000'>The reasons are:</p>

<p class='c000'><em>I</em>.—In making a price on a 40-acre farm, the owner does not make
two prices, one on land and one on improvements. He arrives at a flat
price per acre for the entire farm, and usually asks more per acre for
a part than the whole. A man who valued his land at $100 per acre,
with improvements, would hardly sell 5 acres from a corner of his land,
even for residence purposes, at naked land prices.</p>

<p class='c000'>The 1900 appraisal was based on naked land prices, as estimated by
a number of citizens of each county, and this flat rate was used in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>making figures for the so-called "Market Value of Right-of-Way." It
is fair to assume that a railroad company can purchase large tracts of
land for gravel pits, or a narrow strip adjoining and widening its
existing right of way, at about market prices, as the elements of severance,
abutting damages, etc., are absent. Prices for this class of land
ought to be, and usually are, lower than those paid for a new right
of way.</p>

<p class='c018'>Actual purchases are averaged from recent transfers, and represent consideration paid owners, but not cost of acquiring.</p>

<p class='c018'>The 1900 appraisal averages show country land after fixed charges and percentages are added.</p>

<p class='c018'>The tables given herewith are summarized from a very large mass of information introduced as evidence in a suit of Michigan Central Railroad <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">et al.</span></i> <em>vs.</em> Powers (The Michigan Tax Cases), and are selected as average examples of conditions throughout the Southern Peninsula.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is evident from the figures in Table 2 that no such naked land
values as those used in 1900 were considered by the farmers in placing
values on their lands, as the sales covered in that table do not involve
any large element of damages. All transfers are of a strip a rod or
more in width adjoining an existing right of way.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>II.</em>—It is true that in some sections of Michigan there are large
tracts of barren or low-priced land. In 1900 barren land prices were
used, and were much lower than farm land; in the poorer parts of the
State large percentages of barren land were used. This fact brought
the average per acre of country land, as applied in the appraisal, very
low in many of the counties, and justified the appraiser in using the
average country price of 1900 as the base price for a re-valuation.
Generally, the 1900 appraisal averages for country lands were fair indices
of the difference in actual value in different parts of the State.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>In the 1900 appraisal, the Michigan Central was credited with having,
in Jackson County, 309.1 acres of farm land (naked value, $38,
average rate $93.30), and 34.35 acres of barren land at $5 per acre. The
field inspectors reported that part of the district between Parma and
Albion, in the vicinity of Bath Mills, was waste or barren land. The
Jackson and Battle Creek Traction Company parallels and adjoins
the Michigan Central Railroad right of way from Parma to Bath Mills.
An investigation of records of deeds showed that they bought 25.02
acres of land in this district at $65.79 per acre, and that the average
price of all their land in the county was $239.52 per acre.</p>

<p class='c000'>While there was a marked difference in the rates of different grades
of country land, no one would be justified in putting any land south
of a line drawn from Saginaw to Muskegon at prices as low as $2 to
$10 per acre. An average based on the 1900 classification of lands
would probably eliminate all waste land classifications, without doing
any injustice.</p>

<p class='c000'>Table 3 illustrates quite clearly the extremely low figures applied
in many counties in the 1900 appraisal, and also represents quite well
the relative difference in value in the different counties.</p>

<p class='c000'>That the 1900 rate varies about as the purchase price, is shown
by the fact that the Pere Marquette Railroad built a line in Montcalm
County, buying 155.3 acres at an average price of $135.19 per acre,
while the 1900 appraisal showed an average of $29 on the 918 acres
appraised. The purchase price was 4.66 times the 1900 appraisal.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Calhoun County, the Grand Trunk Railroad bought 63.2 acres
at $491.13 per acre, while the 1900 appraisal was $61.44 on all the
country land in the county, or only one-eighth of the actual purchase
price.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span><em>III.</em>—There can be no doubt that a railroad right of way costs much
more than an equal acreage of farm lands. The writer has always
been inclined to hold the view that an ordinary right of way through
good farming country would cost from two to three times farm prices,
no matter how much care is used in the acquisition of the land. In
recent years the price of right of way has been greatly increased. The
Newton and Northwestern Railroad right of way, in Iowa, cost $267
per acre, on a line 80 miles long. This is nearly all country land,
about 1 mile in the outskirts of Boone (population 12,000), and
about ½ mile in Newton (population 6,500), being the only city land to
increase the average. The Rock Island System and the Chicago Great
Western paid higher country prices in the same territory. This line
is in such country as Southern Michigan, and land is held at from
$65 to $100 per acre.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Toledo Urban and Interurban right of way, in Lucas County,
Ohio, was bought by the writer in 1901 at an average net price of
$329.21 per acre. The average assessed valuation is $55 per acre. The
going value of farm lands will range from $100 to $225; probably a
fair average is $135 per acre. The prices paid by Michigan railroads
are fully sustained by these personal experiences.</p>

<p class='c000'>The figures in Table 4 show that the actual average price paid for
new right of way is greater than the average of the 1900 appraisal,
after the 125% and fixed charges are added, by from 230 to 726 per
cent.</p>

<p class='c000'>The argument that a change of line costs more than a new line
is not sustained by Table 4. In Jackson County, the Michigan Central
Railroad changed its line at an average cost of $165.67 per acre. The
Jackson and Battle Creek, a new line, parallel with and adjoining the
Michigan Central, paid $239.53; the Jackson and Suburban, a new
electric line, paid $293.34, and the "Ypsi-Ann" Electric paid $393.74.
All the new lines in Monroe County are higher than any changes of
line in similar country. The Ann Arbor change in Washtenaw County,
located by the writer, is at one point 3 miles from the old right of way,
and only at the two ends of the 7-mile line does it run on farms owned
by parties crossed by the old road; therefore, to all intents and purposes,
it is a new line.</p>

<p class='c000'>The naked land values used in 1900, being clearly too low, were of
no use and were dropped. The so-called market price of right of way
as given in 1900 was misleading.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having shown that there is an increase in cost of railroad over farm
land, the question arises: Is it legitimate? If it is a proper item of
cost, has it a place in the present value column?</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>In building a new railroad, engineers prepare their estimates of
cost, including grading, rail and fastenings, ties, bridges, and, among
other items, right of way. Their clients provide funds to build the
line, and furnish, among other items, cash for the right of way. The
right-of-way account in no wise differs from that of any other item of
physical cost. The right of way, with all its hold-ups, items for damages,
court costs, legal expenses, bills for personal services and expenses
in securing it, abstracts and recording of deeds, is just as much
an element of physical cost as the rails. The cost of acquiring the
right of way is as proper an element as charges for inspecting the
rails, freight charges on them, the loading and unloading, or any other
charges that enter into the cost of rails delivered to the track-laying
contractor.</p>

<p class='c000'>Should the cost of reproduction of right of way be carried to the
present value column? Clearly, yes. If a road is unfortunate enough
to buy its rails when they are at a price of $60 per ton, the full price
is charged to capital account; and when the line is sold to some large
corporation, no reduction is made, even though the price of rails be
much less at the time, but the selling price is based on the construction
account as a whole.</p>

<p class='c000'>The same is true of the right of way. In no case which has come
under the writer's notice has a new company, or a set of promoters
disposing of a new line or a new right of way, ever consented to deal
except on the basis of construction account, plus promoters' profit. The
cost of a right of way is increased on account of continuity. A farmer
is justified in increasing his price per acre by reason of the fact that
the road must have a continuous line, regardless of how it affects the
individual. He must rearrange his fields, replant his orchard, change
his fences, ditches, and tile lines, and re-adjust his entire property
to accommodate the necessity of the road. He must also take into account
severance or damages. He is compelled to cross the line at an
inconvenient place, open and close two gates in every lane or at every
crossing, drive his cattle back and forth to water, haul his produce
over a short heavy grade across the track, and he must not interfere
with the railroad. He is in constant danger of loss of property from
fire or from accident, and he is in personal danger every time he passes
from his own land on one side of the railroad to his own land on the
other side. Every one who has bought right of way knows these arguments,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>and is aware that the farmer knows them and charges extra on
account of them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The law provides that, in condemnation, the jury shall take into
account two elements, the value of the land, and damages. The railroad
pays them, and very promptly charges the entire cost to the right-of-way
account. No one will question the propriety of the farmer
taking them into account in fixing his price. The value of continuity
to the railroad can hardly be measured in dollars and cents.</p>

<p class='c000'>A fair illustration of continuity may be found in coal lands. A
promoter will secure option on a large acreage. As long as his holdings
are disconnected and widely separated they are of no more value
than adjoining lands, but let him close options on a large block of land
all in one body, and immediately he can add from 100 to 200% to
the value of his land for mining purposes. This added percentage is
due to continuity.</p>

<p class='c000'>The conditions surrounding the purchase of railway lands in Michigan
have changed materially in the past few years. In a new country,
without means of transportation, land values are low, and, in order to
open new markets, land owners can afford to donate the right of way.
Undoubtedly, a very large percentage of the total right of way on the
older lines was either donated or bought at very low prices. As a
community grows and develops, acquires new industries, and receives
new improvements, property values increase; and, along with a general
appreciation of other values, those of railroad property must increase.
It would certainly be true that the present value of the site of the Majestic
Building, in Detroit, is not the same as it was in 1850; the argument
that its actual cost in 1850 was, say, $200, would not be any justification
for such a value to-day. Equally is it true that the value of
property owned by the Michigan Central Railroad is not to be measured
by the price paid for it 50 years ago. The greater business, and the
larger income derived from that business, make the Detroit of to-day
a much more valuable terminal for the road than the Detroit of 50
years ago.</p>

<p class='c000'>The same argument will apply to any city which has grown up after
the construction of railroads. The original right of way was farm
land and may have been a donation, but the change from farm to city
certainly increases the value of the railroad land just in proportion as
the surrounding land increases.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>The same reasoning is properly applicable to lands which decrease
in value. Where a railroad buys right of way to gain access to valuable
timber lands, and, after the removal of the timber, the land is
too poor to support a population, the present value should depreciate
in the same ratio as the surrounding land, and immediately on its
abandonment as a right of way it would cease to have a railroad value.</p>

<p class='c000'>In an appraisal, it appears to be fair to base the cost of reproduction
on the cost of building a new line on the location of the road under
appraisal, all other means of transportation remaining as they are
to-day, so as to secure as nearly as possible the conditions that would
be encountered by a new company building a new line on this location.</p>

<p class='c000'>The argument was made in 1900, and reiterated frequently, that
railroad companies secure many donations. It may safely be said
that, in a developed country, such as in the south half of the Lower
Peninsula, the donations are of little account. Few donations were
found in an examination of records of deeds covering 10 years; and in
some cases the conditions were so burdensome that it may be said that
the gift land was the most expensive. A condition for a cattle-pass
costing from $400 to $600, a side-track costing from $1 to $1.50 per
ft., and other like specifications are found; and in many deeds where
a liberal consideration is named conditions which add greatly to the
cost are not infrequent.</p>

<p class='c000'>The recent new lines in Southern Michigan secured but few donations,
although all considerations of $1 and other good and valuable
considerations were classed as donations unless the contrary was susceptible
of proof. In the case of the Ann Arbor Railroad, in Washtenaw
County, the $1 consideration represents a higher price than the
average, this being known by the writer, as he bought it. The same is
true of the Detroit and Toledo Shore Line, in Monroe County. In
making an appraisal, no deductions should be made for donations, if
there are any, as the fact that land is donated does not indicate absence
of value; nor should an addition be made to the appraisal value on
account of the fact that a road has been held up and compelled to pay
exorbitant prices in certain localities.</p>

<p class='c000'>In some counties the base values of land in villages and small
towns were given at ridiculously low prices in 1900; some are as low
as from $50 to $100 per acre in towns of from 1,000 to 3,000 population.
When one stops to consider that a lot 4 by 8 rods contains ⅕ acre, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>that such lots in a town of considerable size range from $50 to $300
each, it is readily seen that from $250 to $1,500 per acre are not excessive
figures. The figures for an adjoining county were often very high,
and village values were put up to substantially full value. The result
of adding percentages in 1900 was to magnify discrepancies, and little
villages of from 200 to 500 population in one county were appraised
at a higher rate than towns of from 2,000 to 5,000 in the next.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1902 the appraiser undertook to equalize all such discrepancies,
and found that no hard-and-fast rule would apply. A comparison of
village values, as determined by actual purchase, with the 1900 appraisal,
is given in Table 5.</p>

<p class='c000'>The 1900 appraisal for city lands, outside of Detroit and Grand
Rapids, was generally very conservative or low. In some cases the
figures were extremely low.</p>

<p class='c000'>The conclusion reached by the appraiser in 1902 was that, for
railroad purposes, right of way is worth what it costs to produce it.
It would be just as consistent to claim that a railroad has a misfortune
in having a river to cross, and that no value should be placed on the
bridge which spans it, as to claim that right of way, which costs three
times farm-land values, should not be valued at a higher figure than
farm land.</p>

<p class='c000'>The problem of an appraiser is to determine, with the best evidence
at hand, what land is fairly worth for railroad purposes at the time
of appraisal. He must take into account the railway-purpose increment,
if he is consistent in his appraisal.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>Non-Physical Values.</h3>

<p class='c014'>The foregoing narrative account of the general field and office
handling of the Michigan appraisal of physical property, while not
touching on matters of principle of valuation, except as to land
values, is submitted as describing briefly the machinery of the appraisal.
A number of very important issues were raised which have to do
with the theory of valuation. These are worthy of discussion at
length, in the subsequent consideration of the method of determination
of a fair value, but are not here referred to. Within any short
limits it is impossible to give a comprehensive description in detail
of all the work of the Michigan appraisal. Several articles descriptive
of this work have been written, giving quite full extracts from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>various sets of rules which were promulgated, and describing some
phases of the work in much more detail than is here attempted.</p>

<p class='c000'>The physical valuation, as represented by two figures—the cost
of reproduction of the physical property, and its present value—was
submitted to the Board of State Tax Commissioners as the
work of Professor Cooley, and in most of the literature descriptive
of it, it has been termed the "Cooley Appraisal."</p>

<p class='c000'>After the completion of Professor Cooley's work, his figures were
submitted to Professor Henry C. Adams, who had been making a
study of the income accounts of the various companies, and to whom
had been assigned the duty of determining the non-physical or franchise
values of the properties.</p>

<p class='c000'>Professor Adams has described<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c003'><sup>[5]</sup></a> very fully the plan adopted for
this work, and this plan has been commented on so fully that any
lengthy description is deemed unnecessary. It appears to be perfectly
proper, however, to correct certain misstatements regarding this work.</p>

<p class='c000'>When it was first determined to make the appraisal, Professor
Cooley—not Professor Adams—was requested to take charge. The
assignment to Professor Adams of the non-physical valuation was
made after the physical valuation was well under way.</p>

<p class='c000'>The use of a negative or subtractive non-physical value was considered,
and advised by Professor Adams. The work was not undertaken
with a view of "increasing the assessments," but to put the
Tax Commission in possession of a figure which would represent the
business value of the property as well as the physical value.</p>

<p class='c000'>Professor Adams held that the non-physical element of value was
not a simple commercial element, but included:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in14'>{to be a corporation,</div>
      <div class='line'>The franchise {to use public property,</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The possession of traffic not exposed to competition,</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The possession of traffic through connections,</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The benefit of economies due to density of traffic,</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The value due to organization and vitality of industries served.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>He also held that, as nothing visible or tangible gave support to
this value, it must be determined on the basis of information secured
from the income accounts of the company.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>Without going into any complete description of Professor Adams'
method, it may be said that he made an analysis of the income accounts,
and, after providing for operating expenses and taxes, he deducted,
as an annuity properly chargeable to capital, a certain percentage
of the appraised value of the physical properties. Any remainder was
capitalized to give the true value of the immaterial element, or the
business value.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the rates of capitalization and annuity used in 1902, there were
certain changes, making them differ from those used in 1900, and certain
changes in the detail of analysis of income accounts and methods of
determining the rates of interest which are entirely immaterial to
the present narrative. The work was of great importance as being the
first exposition of this method of obtaining non-physical values. It
was a fair, logical, and business-like attempt to determine those
elements which give a well-designed, economically-built, or advantageously-located
property a greater value as a money-earning concern
than the actual capital invested, or than the actual value remaining
in its physical property.</p>

<p class='c000'>It will be seen that, in the case of a property in which the surplus
earnings depend on excessive rates for service, it will fail as a method
of determining a value for use as a basis of rate-making; and it
fails, in the form in which it was used in 1900 and 1902, to bring
out those negative or subtractive elements which may be determined
from the income accounts, in the case of properties which do not earn
a fair return on the investment. This, however, was due to the fact
that the taxation laws of Michigan made no provision for any reduction
of value because property was idle or non-productive, and any such
deduction in the case of corporation property would place it on a
different basis from other property. Professor Adams and his associates,
therefore, applied only positive values, where any such were found,
although advocating the use of negative values.</p>

<p class='c000'>The writer has seen no criticism of Professor Adams' work which
is not apparently incited by, either the direct interest of corporations
in lowering valuations for taxation, or by an effort to confuse the
subject of valuation so as to discredit the work in the eyes of taxing
authorities. Any person competent to discuss the matter, who has
given Professor Adams' method careful thought, will be forced to the
conclusion that this was a long step in the direction of the final
solution of these important and perplexing elements of value.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>History and Results of the Michigan Appraisal.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Based on the valuation of 1900, the Board of State Tax Commissioners
was enabled to comply with the statute in reporting to the
Legislature. New laws were passed, sundry suits were brought, and,
finally, the case of the Michigan Central Railroad <em>vs.</em> Perry F. Powers,
Auditor-General, and a number of other cases in behalf of other roads,
were brought to trial before the United States Court for the Western
District of Michigan.</p>

<p class='c000'>This Michigan Central case was a suit to restrain the collection
of taxes based on the new assessment, the railroads claiming that
their property was assessed at full value, while general properties of
the State were assessed at a considerably lower percentage than full
value. This suit was essentially a valuation of the railroad properties
as of April, 1902. This work was done along the same line as the
former valuation, by a portion of the same staff. The old work was
brought down to date, and certain special studies were made, which
resulted in a change of right-of-way valuation, as has been related.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the trial of the case of Michigan Central Railroad <em>vs.</em> Powers,
the two valuations were fully testified to by all the men engaged,
and the record relative to the appraisal fills several volumes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Subsequently, in 1906, Professor Cooley was engaged by the
Attorney-General, and, re-assembling the staff, brought the work down
to date as of April, 1906.</p>

<p class='c000'>There has been no permanent force engaged on the work in Michigan,
and the re-appraisals have only been made as actual necessity
demanded.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Market Value of Stocks and Bonds.</em>—During the progress of the
appraisal of 1900 an independent force of men was engaged in studying
the market values of stocks and bonds of Michigan roads with a view
to securing information on every possible line that would aid the
appraiser in reaching proper conclusions, or enable him to check his
figures. These figures were used only as a check, and no report of
the details of this work was submitted.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Error in Published Reports as to Michigan Work.</em>—In several
articles descriptive of the Michigan work, one quite serious misstatement
of fact has inadvertently been made. The writer is not
quite sure how or where the wrong impression originated, but it has
been noted in several articles and editorials.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>Substantially, all accounts are similar to that of Professor Taylor,<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c003'><sup>[6]</sup></a>
which is:</p>

<p class='c000'>"In looking over the notes and results of the work done in Michigan,
it was noticed that Mr. Cooley's engineers, car-men and other
experts went over the property of each railway company and
enumerated and valued the same, and then the railway company generally
had its own men perform the same work in order to check
up the appraisal made by the State authorities. Thus, this expensive
work was unnecessarily duplicated."</p>

<p class='c000'>Undoubtedly this statement was made in good faith, and has
gained currency by not having been corrected, but it is not the fact.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Chicago and Northwestern Railway took immediate steps to
make surveys and secure data, as has been described, and made a
complete appraisal, using the Michigan forms. The result of this
appraisal was:</p>

<table class='table6' summary='appraisal'>
  <tr>
    <td class='c020'>Chicago and Northwestern, present value</td>
    <td class='c021'>$8,551,530</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c020'>State appraisal, present value</td>
    <td class='c021'>8,281,090</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c000'>In this case the railroad had no records, and the work was of value
to them, not only as a check on the work of the State, but also as
giving them complete records of permanent way. It was not done
independently of, and after, the State work, but was organized so
that the field work of both railroad company and State was done at
the same time.</p>

<p class='c000'>No other complete work of valuation was done by the railroad companies.
During the trial of the cases, no contrary or different valuations
were set up. No special attack was made on the work, except
to select here and there some specific example of a building which
was appraised at a higher figure than cost, perhaps half a dozen in all,
and to introduce expert evidence, particularly on land and right-of-way
values. Aside from the money expended on the litigation, there were
no expenditures by the roads in checking up the work. On the contrary,
a number of managers, at their own expense, had typewritten copies
of the final report as to their own lines made, in order to file in their
records.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is a fact that only one of the seventy-eight roads made a complete
appraisal, covering 387.8 miles of main line, and none of the other
roads or mileage went to any considerable expense.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span><em>The Cost of the Work.</em>—No complete statement of the total cost
of the work of valuation in Michigan has ever been issued as a public
document. The cost of the work, including salaries of appraiser,
engineers, assistants, clerks, all expenses of the Board of Review,
all expenses connected with Professor Adams' non-physical appraisal,
also all office rent, stationery, supplies, telegraph, telephone, and railroad
expenses, printing and binding—in short every dollar chargeable to
the Michigan railroad appraisal of 1900—footed up to $70,604.21.</p>

<p class='c000'>The exact figures of cost of the subsequent work of appraisal, or
the costs of the litigation, are not available to the writer. In a general
way, it may be said that the cost to the State of the railroad tax
cases was not far from $75,000, and that the expenses of the second
and third appraisals were less than $50,000, so that, to date, the entire
cost to the State of Michigan is less than $200,000 for the three
appraisals and the litigation growing out of them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some information as to details of costs may not be out of place.
All employees were paid a salary and required to provide their own
subsistence. Salaries ranged from $250 to $500 per month for experienced
men, from $125 to $250 for men with only a few years of
experience, and from $75 to $125 for assistants and clerks.</p>

<p class='c000'>All traveling expenses (except hotel and subsistence) were paid,
the State issuing mileage books to all employees, and receiving a
complete check on the movements of every man through the mileage
bureau. The telegraph and long-distance telephone were used almost
exclusively in communication between the office and the men in the
field, all bills being paid by the State. All expenses of inspection
by hand-car, velocipede-car, etc., were paid by the State, except as the
roadmasters made trips with the inspectors.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>The unvarying policy of the appraiser was to reimburse the companies
for all extra expenses incurred on account of the work, and to
accept no transportation or favors from any company.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>The Result of the Michigan Work.</em>—Any undertaking must be
judged by its results. The Attorney-General's report for 1906, on
pages <a href='#Page_21'>21</a> and <a href='#Page_23'>23</a>, states:</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>"These cases are among the most important in the history of the
State. They constitute the last step in subjecting railroad property
in Michigan to taxation on the same basis and at the same rate as
other property is taxed, and secure practical uniformity and equality
of taxation between railroad and other property.</p>

<p class='c000'>"As a result of these cases the various railroad corporations paid
in taxes $4,787,478.15, and as penalty thereon $1,158,321.18, a total
amount of $5,945,799.43 for the years 1902, 1903 and 1904. The
1905 tax being paid soon after the decision of the Supreme Court,
nothing was paid under the former law (specific tax on earnings) and,
of course, there was no penalty on the 1905 taxes as they were paid
before May 1, 1906."</p>

<p class='c000'>In short, the roads are paying to the State of Michigan an average
of $1,595,826.05 more per year than they paid under the old law,
and to date the State has received about $10,750,000 more from taxes
than it would have received under the old specific tax law.</p>

<p class='c000'>Railroad development in Michigan has received no appreciable
check, and notwithstanding a 2-cent fare and the bearing of an equal
burden of taxation, the properties are maintained, and improvements,
double-tracking and betterment of general standards fully keep pace
with similar work in other States.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of course, it must be recognized that other forces besides the
appraisal helped to bring this about. The appraisal of 1900 furnished
the information. Public opinion compelled the passage of the needed
laws, and the magnificent legal work of Attorneys-General Blair and
Bird, Congressman Townsend, and Judge Knappen, and their associates,
loyally supported by Professors Cooley and Adams and the
appraisal staff, were all factors in securing the decision of the Supreme
Court of the United States.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>Railroad Appraisal of the State of Texas.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'><em>Authority for the Work.</em>—In 1893 the Legislature of Texas enacted
what is known as the Stock and Bond Law, which was designed to
control and limit the total amount of stocks and bonds that may
be issued on any railroad property to the "reasonable value of said
railroad property." This law further provides that:</p>

<p class='c000'>"It shall be the duty of the Railroad Commission to ascertain,
and in writing report to the Secretary of State, the value of each
railroad in this State including all its franchises, appurtenances and
property."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>The work of valuation in Texas antedates that in Michigan, and
offers some interesting opportunities for comparison of methods under
somewhat similar conditions, as far as the existing roads were concerned.
The work being in the hands of a permanent commission
with very broad powers, it has been possible to secure from recently
built roads very full and specific data as to construction, but with
these later valuations and with the current work of the department,
this paper will not deal.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Commission of Texas interpreted the law to mean the estimated
cost of reproducing or duplicating the properties at the date of valuation,
allowing current market prices for all material and fair valuations
on all real property.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Method of Physical Appraisal.</em>—The Commission duly appointed
engineers to make these valuations. The railroads of the State were
unfavorably disposed toward the work, and were inclined to withhold
information.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Texas staff encountered the difficulty due to destruction or
loss of construction records, maps, and profiles. They had for their
guidance only the profiles, filed under a prior law, and were thus
compelled to depend wholly on original field work to secure their
data. From a paper by R. A. Thompson, M. Am. Soc. C. E.,<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c003'><sup>[7]</sup></a> the
following description is taken:</p>

<p class='c000'>"They [the engineers] with the profiles ... in hand, made
a detailed inspection of the railroads on the ground. The quantities
of excavation and embankment, where the actual quantities could not
be obtained, were estimated approximately from the profiles, using the
center heights of the cross-sections. The classification of the materials
in excavation was determined by inspection. Where original plans
and estimates of cost of the bridges, buildings and structures of all
kinds could not be obtained from the records of the railroads, their
value was estimated from measurements taken on the ground. The
extent and acreage of the right of way, the depot and terminal grounds,
were determined by actual measurement, or from maps furnished by
railroads, or from city and county tax records.</p>

<p class='c000'>"After an examination of a railroad had been made by the engineers
of the Commission, its valuation was prepared on estimate sheets.
Upon sheets marked Estimate Sheet A ... were recorded the
values of the right of way and depot grounds, roadbed, track, bridges,
structures and way building for each mile, the value of ten miles being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>recorded on each sheet.... On these sheets space was provided
for the units and prices, and columns for carrying out the values for
each mile and the totals.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The value of all rolling stock and equipment, and the value of
such properties as were properly applicable and chargeable to the
entire railroad, were recorded on a separate estimate sheet, only one
sheet being used for a railroad."</p>

<p class='c000'>It thus appears that the general methods of securing the data and
making the field examination were quite similar to those adopted on
the Michigan work. The classification of items on the sheets is rather
more full than on the Michigan summary sheets, but apparently not
so completely in detail as the final compilation of work. In general,
however, the physical items included are complete in both cases. The
form in which the results are finally put up is radically different.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following points of variations from the practices of the Michigan
appraisal are noted:</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>a</em>) The unit prices were current market prices.</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>b</em>) The value applied to right of way and real estate used for
railway purposes was in accordance with the current market value of
other property immediately adjoining, disregarding donations or property
acquired at less than value.</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>c</em>) No deduction was made on account of depreciation, as it was
considered that all structures must be maintained in first-class, serviceable
value, and renewed when necessary, and no allowance was made
for appreciation of roadbed.</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>d</em>) No allowance was made for franchise values of any kind,
except track rights in streets.</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>e</em>) No allowance was made for contingencies, except as made in
prices or quantities.</p>

<p class='c000'>Their practice was in accord with the Michigan appraisal, in
allowing from 5 to 6% to cover legal and engineering expenses and
superintendence, and from 5 to 6% to cover interest during construction.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>The Result of the Texas Work.</em>—The object sought in Texas was
to secure a capitalization in harmony with the actual investment in
the physical property; in short, to "squeeze out water."</p>

<p class='c000'>Of course, all stock and bond issues outstanding in 1894 are
still in existence, except as a few roads have been sold out or re-organized.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>No new issues of stock or bonds may be made on roads
in excess of the valuation. Consequently, new roads are limited to
issues of bonds not far from $15,000 per mile. The effect is shown
by Table 8, from the Railroad Commission's Report.</p>

<p class='c000'>E. L. Corthell, M. Am. Soc. C. E., speaking of results secured by

<p class='c000'>"The law, and generally its just operation, has cured many unmitigated

of transportation, and the investor knows what he is purchasing, and
may be reasonably sure of a return on his investment."</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Thompson says<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c003'><sup>[9]</sup></a>:</p>

<p class='c000'>"Another significant fact is that only a short time before the Stock

11,300 miles in Texas, in the hands of receivers, and, with a few
unimportant exceptions, no railroad has been in the hands of receivers
since the law went into effect. The fact is that there has been no piece

past decade, which has been so fruitful of results and beneficent in
its action, alike to the railroads and the people."</p>

  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>Railroad Appraisal of the State of Wisconsin.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c007'>The State of Wisconsin made a valuation of railroad properties
of the State as of June 30th, 1903, the work being under the direction
of W. D. Taylor, M. Am. Soc. C. E. The plan adopted, the methods of
work, and the general result of independent studies conducted by
Professor Taylor have been described so fully in various technical
papers and reports elsewhere listed, that a very brief statement of
points of difference between the Michigan and Wisconsin works
appears to be all that is necessary here.</p>

<p class='c000'>Professor Taylor associated with him for consultation Professor
Cooley, of Michigan, made a careful study of methods used in earlier
appraisals, used the Michigan blank forms as a basis for the preparation
of his own, and thoroughly outlined his general plan and the
scope of the information desired before actually organizing his staff
or commencing work.</p>

<p class='c000'>In connection with the earlier stages of the work, conferences were
held with the officials of the principal railways of the State, and
developed a thorough understanding and plans for co-operation between
the appraiser and the roads. As a result of these conferences, each
large railway company of the State, acting through its heads of departments,
made an inventory and appraisal of its own property in the
State, using therefor the forms and blanks prepared by the appraiser.
At the same time, the appraiser organized a considerably smaller force
than was used in Michigan, made his own office and field inspection,
and secured data to complete the appraisal on the small roads, in
which their own engineering or operating departments were not
organized so as to do the work according to plan.</p>

<p class='c000'>The work turned out by the large roads was then checked by this
force, the various points in which they were out of harmony were
checked and unified, a number of hearings were held, certain portions
of the work were checked over by the appraisers' men, sundry changes
in quantity and price were made, and finally, when the work was
compiled and put in shape for presentation, the appraiser had reason
to believe that he had secured a result which was reasonably free from
error, and one in which the railroads had co-operated to such an extent
that no charge of prejudice or unfairness would lie.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is noted that the average cost of reproduction and the present
value per mile in Wisconsin are higher than in Michigan, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>is probably as it should be, as Michigan has a less mileage of high-class
main trunk line road than Wisconsin.</p>

<p class='c000'>In general, the two appraisals were very similar. The determination
of unit prices, the placing of depreciation, the apportionment of
locomotives, freight, and passenger equipment, and other rolling stock,
the use of the Interstate Commerce Commission's construction classification,
the application of percentage values for engineering, interest
during construction, administration, legal expenses, and contingencies
(this latter fixed at 5.5%), all were along lines similar to those
developed in Michigan.</p>

<p class='c000'>The work of the Wisconsin appraisal was carried on at the same
time as the second Michigan appraisal. The investigations made
by Mr. Van Ranst Pond and the writer, as to the actual sale prices
of right of way, fully discussed heretofore, were conducted at the
same time as Professor Taylor's work in Wisconsin was being done,
and neither party had any knowledge of the work of the other. The
prior discussion relative to this phase of the Michigan valuation
is practically a revision of a memorandum submitted by the writer
to the Attorney-General in January, 1904. The tables are abstracted
from much more extensive ones which, supported by the evidence
of Registers of Deeds of some ten counties of Michigan, are part
of the record of evidence in Michigan Central Railroad <em>vs.</em> Powers.
It is, therefore, not only of great interest, but great value, as supporting
Professor Cooley's right-of-way valuations, to note the following
extract<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c003'><sup>[10]</sup></a> from Professor Taylor's discussion of the paper by
Mr. R. A. Thompson on the Texas railroad valuations:</p>

<p class='c000'>"In the Wisconsin appraisal, the method followed for valuing the
right of way and terminal lands was about as given below. Parts of
the right of way of some of the larger systems are estimated at higher
ratios than this, but in such cases the roads themselves fixed the right-of-way
value.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The market value for other purposes of the right of way and
terminal lands was judged to be the same as that of contiguous
property.</p>

<p class='c000'>"In farming lands, small towns, and suburban and residence
property, the right-of-way value was taken to be 250% of the market
value for other purposes.</p>

<p class='c000'>"In city property, the right-of-way value was taken to be 133%
of the market value for other purposes, where the land was owned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>in strips of 100 ft. width or less, and 110% of the market value for
other purposes, where the land was owned in blocks, or in widths
greater than 100 ft."</p>

<p class='c000'>No effort whatever was made in the Wisconsin valuation to
determine any non-physical or intangible values, the report covering
only cost of reproduction and present value of the physical properties.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Wisconsin work is noteworthy as the first appraisal in which
the hearty co-operation of the railroads was secured from the outset.
In Michigan the roads at the inception viewed the work with distrust,
but by the completion were in hearty sympathy with the efforts of the
appraiser to use just and honorable methods, and the managements
extended every courtesy in the way of access to records for verification
purposes.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>The Minnesota State Railway Appraisal.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The valuation of railway properties in the State of Minnesota was
undertaken with a view to establishing a basis for rate-making. The
work was in charge of Mr. Dwight C. Morgan, Engineer of the
Railroad and Warehouse Commission of the State, whose full and
complete report is a very valuable addition to the literature of
valuation practice. This work was undertaken after the completion
of that in Michigan and Wisconsin, and advantage was taken of
the experiences of the appraisers in these two States. The Wisconsin
plan of co-operation with the railroads was adopted, and each company
scheduled and appraised its own lines.</p>

<p class='c000'>The "cost of reproduction," and "present value of physical properties"
were the two sets of figures shown in the final results.</p>

<p class='c000'>Unit prices were fixed on the basis of current prices in 1905, in
preference to an average of 5 or 10 years.</p>

<p class='c000'>Apportionment of locomotives and rolling stock was made on
an engine- and car-mileage basis. The organization of an office
force was undertaken, and special study was made of the subjects
of unit prices and the various local conditions surrounding the different
properties, checking of quantities of earthwork, rails, etc., and preparing
to harmonize and unify the estimates as they should be received from
the railroads.</p>

<p class='c000'>The greatest difference between this work and that in the other
States was the fact that the field inspection, instead of being made
by many men, was made by Appraiser Morgan, accompanied by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>two assistants, inspection being made in a special train, which was
paid for by the State.</p>

<p class='c000'>The detailed reports of the railroad companies were completed
and in the hands of the appraiser, maps and profiles of the road
were prepared and available, the train was run at slow speed, and
many stops were made for examination of bridges, culverts, and
structures. About 100 miles per day were covered, but this did not
include the larger terminals of St. Paul, Minneapolis, and Duluth,
which were given many days.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the preparation of final summaries, percentage values were
placed as follows:</p>

<table class='table11' summary='percentage values'>
  <tr>
    <td class='c025'>Engineering, superintendence, and legal</td>
    <td class='c026'>4½ per cent.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c025'>Contingencies</td>
    <td class='c026'>5   "    "</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c025'>Interest, time of construction varying according to mileage from 1 to 8 years</td>
    <td class='c026'>4   "    "</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c000'>In addition to these three items, the item of "adaptation and solidification
of roadbed" was given a large place, being, for all the roads
of the State, $11,743,007.15. This feature was novel to this class
of valuation, and it is to be regretted that, in his report, the appraiser
did not narrate more fully the detailed methods by which he arrived
at his resultant figure.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Land Valuation.</em>—The vexed question of a proper value to give
to lands owned by a railway company, was treated by Appraiser
Morgan in a different way than it had been in Wisconsin or Michigan.
A number of special agents were appointed, who made an exhaustive
study of the transfers and assessed values throughout the State. The
discussion of this subject in Mr. Morgan's report is exhaustive, and
of great interest. The conclusions are quoted. It is regretted that the
discussion of methods of valuation can only be given in brief form.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Careful and full consideration of all information made available
for establishing the value of the right of way owned and used by the
railway companies for railway purposes, led to the conclusion that
in the state at large exclusive of the three terminals of St. Paul,
Minneapolis and Duluth, a multiple of three (3) applied to the true
value or normal value of lands, as obtained from the transfers, would
in general satisfy the conditions.</p>

<p class='c000'>"During the period referred to, the railway companies paid for the
property acquired by them, over and above its normal value, an amount
sufficient to justify the use of the following multiples: St. Paul, one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>and three-fourths (1¾); Minneapolis, one and three-fifths (1⅗), and
Duluth, one and one-fourth (1¼), which when applied to the normal
value of the lands as established from contiguous and surrounding
property, formed the basis for measuring the cost of reproducing the
existing terminals of the railway companies."</p>

<p class='c000'>In the final compilation of results, two sets of schedules were
rendered:</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>a</em>) Those which gave the land values with added increment,</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>b</em>) Those which omitted the increment.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cost of the engineering work was about $70,000; this covered
7,596.4 miles of main track, 427.4 miles of second track, and 2,414
miles of side-track, or a total of 10,437.8 miles of all tracks. As yet
there has been no decision by the Courts on the Minnesota rate cases.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Forms Used in the Compilation of Information.</em>—The forms used
in the Michigan appraisal have been described and fully illustrated.
They were all printed on 8½ by 11-in. sheets.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Wisconsin appraisal used the Michigan forms as a basis, twenty
of them being practically identical with the corresponding Michigan
forms. The forms shown by Figs. 11 to 21 are materially different
from those used in Michigan.</p>

<p class='c000'>The forms used in Minnesota in 1906 were based on those of
Michigan and Wisconsin, and were printed on 14 by 18½-in. sheets.
They were remodeled and elaborated to such an extent, however, that
the writer believes himself justified in submitting reproductions of the
entire set, as representing the most complete form for inventory yet
used on any of the State appraisals.</p>

<p class='c000'>The appraiser in Nebraska in 1909, and Mr. Hansel in New Jersey
in 1910, have both returned to the 8½ by 11-in. sheets, and, while
both clearly followed earlier precedent in general, both have modified
the details to suit the requirements in their respective States.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>From Mr. Gillette's report,<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c003'><sup>[11]</sup></a> supplemented by information furnished
by Henry L. Gray, Assoc. M. Am. Soc. C. E., Engineer of the
Railroad Commission of Washington, the following general statement
as to methods is gleaned:</p>

<p class='c000'>The plan involved, not only a determination of cost of reproduction
and present value, but also original cost.</p>

<p class='c000'>The appraiser was unable to adopt the methods followed in Wisconsin
and Minnesota, in so far as they accepted the inventory of
the railroads, but made his own examinations of records. The railroads
of the State denied that they had any information whatever that
would be of value to the Commission.</p>

<p class='c000'>The records of the Engineering Department were examined. The
records of the Accounting Department were analyzed, various annual
reports were examined and a corporate history of the road prepared.</p>

<p class='c000'>Special forms for securing information were not prepared, and
no rules, or definite order of procedure to be used for all roads alike,
were adopted.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is somewhat difficult to determine from the appraiser's report
just what part of it covers actual work done, and what part is theory
developed from the work, but presumably maps were prepared and
profiles secured which represented the original conditions of construction.</p>

<p class='c000'>The field inspection was made on hand-cars or on foot, each field
inspector being furnished with the plans, profiles, etc.</p>

<p class='c000'>The same conditions existed in Washington as elsewhere, that is,
certain records were not kept up, and were found to be inaccurate
and unreliable, and, as a result, the appraiser reported the condition
to be such as "to cause much unnecessary work subsequently in
checking."</p>

<p class='c000'>A percentage of depreciation was not placed in the field, but was
determined by "mortality tables," or by ascertaining the probable years
of structure life, then determining from the age of the particular
structure under consideration its percentage of depreciation, a method
by no means new. It is not stated that any attempt was made to
compare these tables with the rules of the Master Car Builders Association
for valuing equipment, and no field inspection of equipment was
made. The prevailing prices of materials formed the basis for
estimating the cost of reproduction.</p>

<p class='c000'>The value of motive power and rolling stock was apportioned among
the States on the basis of engine- and car-mileage.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>The land values were fixed by the Railroad Commission sitting
as a court; real estate men from the large cities, real estate experts
brought by the railway companies, and others testified; and, based
on this testimony, the value was determined by the Commission in
the same manner as in a condemnation case. Three right-of-way
experts, all of whom had had experience in purchasing right of way for
roads, were in the regular employ of the Commission, and details
as to present values were referred to them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The chief point of difference between this work and that of the other
States apparently was the effort to ascertain first cost of the properties
plus additions. This was done by an examination of the accounts of
the railway companies.</p>

<p class='c000'>The result of the Washington work, as far as rate-making is
concerned, is indeterminate, as the United States Courts have held
that the Commission may not fix freight rates. The Supreme Court
of the State has held that they could. The Supreme Court has
also held that the Tax Commission should accept the findings of the
Railroad Commission for the purpose of taxation, with the result, as
stated by Mr. Gray, that more than $1,250,000 more was received
last year than during any prior year from railroad taxes.</p>

<p class='c000'>The report of the Washington appraiser differs widely from that
for other States in that it is diffuse and does not present the methods
clearly and systematically; it is difficult, indeed, to trace what was
actually done. The writer is loath to criticize, but this report is such
as to suggest comment on a number of points.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>1.</em>—Throughout the report very great stress is laid on the cost
of making the appraisal. Such an undertaking as an appraisal of
corporation property should be done thoroughly or left alone. It
matters not whether the work of Professor Cooley or Professor Taylor
cost $5 a mile or $50 a mile, if a dependable result was secured.
It does not appear to be good taste either to criticize costs of work in
other States, or compare the costs in Wisconsin and Michigan with
the costs in Washington.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>2.</em>—A number of criticisms, amounting almost to reflections, are
made on the methods elsewhere. The appraiser says:</p>

<p class='c000'>"Speaking for myself, I found the precedents established by Texas,
Michigan, and Wisconsin of little value either in deciding the methods
to be pursued in making the appraisals or in estimating the probable
cost of appraisal....</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>"In estimating present or depreciated values of structures, rolling
stock, etc., both Michigan and Wisconsin had sent experts into the field
to estimate the percentage of present value to each unit. In this manner
40,000 freight cars were inspected in Michigan and their 'present
value' estimated. To me this seemed to be not only a useless procedure
but very erroneous....</p>

<p class='c000'>"The appraisals heretofore made in other states have been based
almost entirely upon field surveys and inspection, no attempt having
been made to secure the necessary data from the engineering and accounting
records of the railways. Why? The answer is found in the
purpose of the appraisal."</p>

<p class='c000'>Such sentences, and others which, by inference if not by name, reflect
on work executed by men of high professional standing, are hardly
in good taste, even if true, in a report to a railroad commission of another
State. Whether or not he found little of value, the appraiser's
general line of procedure was not radically different from that followed
in Michigan and Wisconsin in getting all available data first from the
companies, then in making a field inspection before fixing values. If
misled by erroneous profiles, he went into an error needlessly, as it was
fully known in Michigan that records were in the condition described
before any field work was begun.</p>

<p class='c000'>The inspection of freight cars in Michigan was not to "estimate
present value" but to determine at first hand whether the Master Car
Builders rules for valuation were safe to use, and to back up their use
in Court.</p>

<p class='c000'>The third paragraph quoted is a misstatement, due clearly to a
misapprehension of what really was done.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>3.</em>—The spirit of suspicion of railroad men's motives is an unfortunate
one to carry into a railroad appraisal, much less into a report.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>4.</em>—The writer fully realizes the magnitude of the task before the
appraiser who is asked to determine first cost plus improvements or
betterments.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hardly a trunk line road exists to-day that has not grown up from a
small beginning, changed its line, reduced its grades, added safety
devices, changed the type of its bridges and buildings, increased the
weight of its rails, put in service much heavier equipment, in fact,
completely changed everything, except, perhaps, the original right of
way.</p>

<p class='c000'>The task of securing from old accounting department records an
accurate statement of cost is—and the writer says it with the confidence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>born of experience—an impossibility. It is a job of such magnitude as
to be practically prohibitive. The different systems of accounting, the
different policies of the management, as to charging betterments to
capital or operating expense, to say nothing of the countless errors
that creep into the distribution of accounts, place such an undertaking
among the labors of a modern Hercules, and, to one who has been engaged
even in the task of trying to ascertain what one year's accounting
on a large road may do in concealing betterments under the guise
of operating expense, it would appear that a result that could be sworn
to as correct was impossible of attainment along the lines suggested
in this report.</p>

<p class='c000'>The general question of the propriety of the use of mortality tables
is discussed elsewhere in this paper.</p>

<p class='c000'>This document, as an addition to the literature of the subject of
valuation of properties, is disappointing, for if there were original and
valuable methods they are not explicitly described.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cost of making the appraisal was about $13 per mile of line.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>The Valuation of Traction Properties in Chicago.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>During 1906 a complete valuation of the property and franchises of
the surface roads of Chicago was made under the direction of a Commission
consisting of Bion J. Arnold, M. Am. Soc. C. E., and Messrs.
Mortimer E. Cooley, and A. B. du Pont. The report of this valuation
was published in the form of a pamphlet which is now practically
out of print, as all extra copies were long ago exhausted.</p>

<p class='c000'>The instructions of this Commission from the Chicago City Council
were:</p>

<p class='c000'>"To consider the detailed inventories and estimates of value to be
submitted by the Street Railway Companies, to investigate the same
and to ascertain whether the values thus listed were reasonable, fair
and just."</p>

<p class='c000'>Detailed inventories and estimates of value were submitted by the
roads, and, from time to time during the progress of the work, additions
or corrections to these schedules were made.</p>

<p class='c000'>Reports showing income, operating expense, and traffic statistics
were made, and such detailed statements as were called for from time
to time were furnished.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Commission organized its force for valuation work by using
the office and field organization of the Arnold Company under the direct
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>charge of George Weston, M. Am. Soc. C. E., for the major part of
the work, and retained Messrs. Theodore H. Hinchman, Jr., C. V. Conover,
and the writer to give special study to certain features of the
appraisal. In the determination of franchise values, Professor Henry
C. Adams was retained in consultation by the Commission.</p>

<p class='c000'>In arriving at the value of the physical properties, a complete field
examination was made, depreciation determined, cost of reproduction
estimated, and in general, the work was carried on along lines quite
similar to those of the railway appraisals heretofore described in detail.</p>

<p class='c000'>Several very interesting and unique problems were presented, some
of which were as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>"Upon what basis shall the cable properties of the companies be
estimated—(<em>a</em>) as operating cable systems, or (<em>b</em>) as obsolete systems
having no value except so far as the physical property can be utilized
in the conversion of the cable lines into electric?"</p>

<p class='c000'>In the final conclusions of the Commission, part of the cable lines
were treated in one way, and part in the other.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What allowance, if any, shall be made for the pavements laid by
the companies on their right of way?"</p>

<p class='c000'>The discussion of this topic, together with the opinions of counsel
as to the legal status, is of interest. The Commission did not consider
the value of paving as constituting any part of the physical property,
the value of which must be supported out of earnings. The present
value of the pavement was estimated and reported without specific recommendation
as to whether an allowance should be made.</p>

<p class='c000'>The valuation of real estate was left in the hands of real estate experts
familiar with values in Chicago, each piece of property being
personally examined and valued, and the representatives of the roads
given such hearings as they desired.</p>

<p class='c000'>In computing the value of physical properties, an allowance of 10%
was made to cover the following items:</p>

<p class='c000'>"<em>1.—Legal Expenses</em>—including those incurred in securing right
of way and frontage consents.</p>

<p class='c000'>"<em>2.—Interest or carrying charge</em> for the money expended during the
construction period and up to the time the property goes into operation.</p>

<p class='c000'>"<em>3.—Brokerage</em>—or the expense of securing the necessary moneys.</p>

<p class='c000'>"<em>4.—Contingencies</em>—to cover incomplete inventories, unforeseen
difficulties of construction, and any and all other items of expense
which cannot be foreseen."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>The only novel feature in this list is Item 3, which was not included
specifically in any of the railroad valuations made by States and heretofore
described.</p>

<p class='c000'>The franchise and intangible property valuation, amounting to some
$9,000,000, or about one-fifth of the total, was a very important phase
of the work, and the Commission gave up a large part of the report to
its discussion.</p>

<p class='c000'>The difficulties in this part of the work are described as threefold:</p>

<p class='c000'>"<em>First.</em>—The difficulty of determining what are the exact legal
rights of the companies in any given street or part of street, in absence
of a direct and final judicial decision as to these rights;</p>

<p class='c000'>"<em>Second.</em>—The difficulty in estimating the value of a line of street
railways, consisting of several parts, where each of these parts is operated
under a different tenure due to the character of the ordinances
or franchises, respectively; and</p>

<p class='c000'>"<em>Third.</em>—The difficulties arising from the absence of exact information
as to the receipts and expenditures on the several parts of a single
line covered by franchises of different length and character."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Commission, having arrived at such an adjustment of the difficulties
as appeared just, determined the value of franchises in the
following manner:</p>

<p class='c000'>It was assumed that the gross earnings on the different parts or
routes of each system were in proportion to the car-mileage.</p>

<p class='c000'>The system was divided into routes, and the car-mileage was determined
for each route; then this information was compiled so as to
show the car-mileage, and consequently the gross earnings, apportionable
to each franchise.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next step was to determine, in the same manner, the proportion
of operating expenses assignable to each franchise, the operating expense
being assumed to be uniform with gross earnings. A study of
the conditions in Chicago resulted in a determination upon 70% as
a fair proportion for operating expenses, taxes, and maintenance.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next, the amount of capital investment to be supported out of
earnings was computed by estimating the cost of reproduction of track
and overhead lines under each franchise and apportioning the cost of
land, power-houses, barns, cars, tools, and stores in proportion to car-mileage.</p>

<p class='c000'>In determining earnings for the unexpired years of franchise life,
it was assumed that the earnings would increase in accordance with the
law laid down by Mr. Arnold in 1902.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>The last step was to find the value of the net earnings of future
years, after deducting the sum required to support the invested capital.
The rate chosen was 5% compound interest. The sum of the different
present values thus found was the value of the franchise sought.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two other points arising in connection with franchise values were:</p>

<p class='c000'>"Where, on a street, franchises covering part of the street have expired,
and others remain in force, the contention of the city is that
the expired franchise is valueless because traffic under it can be stopped;
that of the company is that it still has value, as traffic can be routed
over other streets where franchises have not expired."</p>

<p class='c000'>This was set aside on the ground that the value of any particular
portion of a street, or of a franchise, remains the same as long as the
system is considered as an entirety.</p>

<p class='c000'>The second point was as to the value of traffic agreements; but this
complicated problem was also dismissed on the theory that when two
systems are considered as co-operating, the value of individual parts
of either system remains the same regardless of their ownership.</p>

<p class='c000'>The values of their properties, fixed by the companies, included paving.
The total figures reached in this valuation were:</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>The Commercial Valuation of Railway Operating Property of the <br /> Department of Commerce and Labor.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In 1902 the permanent Census Office was established, and the Director
was authorized to collect statistics relative to public indebtedness,
valuation, taxation, and expenditures. The Bureau of the Census
co-operated with the Department of Commerce and Labor in the
preparation of the appraisal of the commercial valuation of railway
properties of the country.</p>

<p class='c000'>The report of this work, issued as Bulletin 21 of the Bureau of the
Census, is the most interesting and valuable exposition of the subject
of railway valuations yet published, as it includes not only the report
of this particular work, together with the results, tabulated by States,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>but appendices describing and discussing the work in States and foreign
countries, and the work of valuation by railway men.</p>

<p class='c000'>The results are of prime interest, as they show the valuation of all
railway property in all the States, based on uniform methods of appraisal
and distribution, which enables a comparison to be made with
work done by the States.</p>

<p class='c000'>The method adopted in this work was so radically different from
that of the various State appraisals as to make a detailed description
a matter of interest, and it is to be regretted that it cannot be included.
The method is really a capitalization of net earnings.</p>

<p class='c000'>Owing to the nature of the inquiry, namely, to determine what part
of the wealth of the nation is devoted to railway transportation, it
was obligatory on the appraisers to adopt a method which would disclose
as nearly as possible the true market value.</p>

<p class='c000'>Certain restrictions and limitations on the term, "value," and on
the use of the resultant figures of the appraisal, are suggested by
Professor Adams, as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>"The valuation submitted in this report may be properly defined as
the commercial value of property used by railways in connection with
the business of transportation. By 'commercial value' is meant the
estimate placed upon the worth of property regarded as a business proposition.
This must, of course, be the market estimate and not the
arbitrary estimate of a public official. The two fundamental considerations
by which the market is influenced in placing a value upon property
when bought or sold, are the expectation of income arising from
the use of the property, and the strategic significance of the property.
These two considerations are made the basis of the valuation of
railway property submitted in this report. The material made use of
in this valuation is, first, the operating and financial accounts of the
railways; second, inter-railway contracts and agreements; and, third,
the published records of the stock market.</p>

<p class='c000'>"This is no place to enter upon a discussion of the nature and classification
of different kinds of value, but a word of caution may be allowed
in order to guard against an unwarranted use of the figures here
submitted. The commercial valuation of railway property, in so far
as it depends on income arising from the sale of transportation, is the
result, among other things, of an established schedule of freight and
passenger rates, from which it follows that such a valuation cannot
be used for determining the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the
rates in question. The solution of the rate problem demands a separate
valuation of the physical property.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>"Again, in so far as the Government is precluded by its political
character from following commercial rules in the sale of any service
which it renders, a commercial valuation which assumes that property
is administered under the rules of private rather than public financiering,
might differ from the valuation of the same property regarded as
a public property. The purpose of this remark is to preclude a discussion
of the problem of the Government purchase of railways on
the basis of the values submitted in this report. It would of course be
necessary to modify these values by considerations of public utility,
in order to determine a public purchase price.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Whether or not the commercial valuation here submitted can be
used as the basis of assessing railway properties for the purpose of
taxation depends entirely upon the taxing laws of the state for which
the question is asked. If these laws confine the appraisal of railway
property to its physical elements, the values here submitted would, in
the case of prosperous roads, exceed an appraisal for the purpose of
taxation. If, on the other hand, it is the purpose of the taxing law
to appraise railway property at its true cash value, unusual or abnormal
conditions being excluded, it may be that the commercial valuation of
operating property submitted in this report fairly measures its
appraisal for the purpose of taxation."</p>

<p class='c000'>The methods are explained in the most minute detail by a series
of papers in the Bulletin.</p>

<p class='c000'>The work of Professor Adams and his associates is of great practical
value in that it shows the discrepancy in the taxation laws of the
different States as relating to railroad properties, and in that it gives
a set of values determined by a uniform method, which, within reasonable
limits, furnishes a check on the work of the State appraisals.</p>

<p class='c000'>This method, of course, cannot be used for purposes of rate-making,
or of bond or stock restrictive legislation, but the general uniformity
of its results with those of State appraisals, and the radical
differences noted in the case of values for taxation in other States,
lead very properly to the inference that a value determined by this
method is very close to the truth.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>The Extent of Appraisal Practice.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>There have been many appraisals of property besides those reviewed
in the foregoing pages. Several excellent contributions to valuation
literature, as a result of the numerous water-works appraisals, are
mentioned in the Appendix.</p>

<p class='c000'>New Jersey and Nebraska have had railway appraisals in progress
during 1909-10. At the time of writing, neither appraisal has gone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>far enough to add any points of interest to the subject, except as the
appraisers in these two States discuss the subject and bring out new
points.</p>

<p class='c000'>Valuations of street railway property have been made in several
cities, Cleveland, Ohio, Detroit, and Milwaukee being the most recent.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Cleveland and Milwaukee hearings have produced large records,
and have tended to determine finally certain principles of valuation.
Several valuations have also been made for corporations, among which
may be mentioned that of The Toledo Railways and Light Company,
by Messrs. Ford, Bacon, and Davis, and that for the New York, New
Haven, and Hartford Railway, under the direction of John F. Stevens,
M. Am. Soc. C. E.</p>

<p class='c000'>This latter valuation offers some very interesting points, and, in
view of Mr. Stevens' standing as a railroad engineer, the adoption by
him of methods of inventory and field inspection would go far toward
fixing a precedent which would be acceptable to the railroads. It is
to be regretted that the interests of the road are such that it is not
deemed wise by its President to discuss even the principles of this
work at present.</p>

<p class='c000'>In connection with the recent appraisal made by the City of
Detroit, The Detroit United Railway made an independent examination
and appraisal of its own property, with the double purpose of
furnishing an inventory to the city and of checking the work of the
staff employed by the city. This work for the railroad was done by
officials and employees of the company, under the personal direction
of Mr. R. B. Rifenberick. It is noteworthy for the completeness of
its inventory, which goes into the most minute detail, and for the
excellence of the maps and drawings which accompany it and show,
not only every standard type of track, rail, and all buildings and
machinery, but every piece of track and overhead special work on the
entire system. This appraisal includes a most complete and exhaustive
study of average unit costs. Inasmuch as this work is likely to
be fully reviewed in the Courts in the near future, any further
description would hardly be proper. It is not too much to say, however,
that it probably stands as the most complete in every detail,
as to inventory and records, of all American appraisals up to this date.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the summer of 1910 the Railway Commission of Michigan
ordered an appraisal of certain large electric-power properties of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>State. This work was done by Professor Mortimer E. Cooley, assisted
by Mr. Henry C. Anderson and the writer. This appraisal, involving
certain comparatively new corporations, made it possible to obtain a
fairly definite solution of some of the problems relative to overhead
charges.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is evident that the demand for valuation work of a high character
will increase, and that it will come, not only from States and
cities, but from corporations. Much of the work done in the past has
not been described in the publications of scientific societies; much
very valuable work has secured only partial notice through reports
of litigation; and it is undoubtedly true that the most complete and
full discussions of the principles of valuation have been in the form
of expert evidence before the Courts, and are buried in the mass of
unprinted records of testimony.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>Review of Some Methods of Valuation, and Some of the Criticisms <br /> on the Michigan Appraisal.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Much of the available literature on the subject of valuations is in
the form of papers descriptive of water-works appraisals and arbitrations,
many of which have been made, and a few of which have been
the subject of valuable papers and discussions before learned societies.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before the American Water-Works Association, D. W. Mead and
J. W. Alvord, Members, Am. Soc. C. E., have presented papers<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c003'><sup>[12]</sup></a> which
have been quite fully discussed. The chief point of interest in these
papers is the treatment of the intangible element termed "going
value." Mr. Alvord advances the argument that, after the determination
of physical present value, there should be added, to determine the
fair value, two non-physical elements: the "going" or "business" value,
and the franchise value. The first element is defined as that special
value which is:</p>

<p class='c000'>"Built up ... by the energy, perseverance and solicitation
of the officers in charge, as distinct from the inert plant itself, ...</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c000'>"The element of 'going value' has been before described as the
element of growth in the plant irrespective of its physical condition.
It is comparable somewhat to that indefinable quality known in other
lines of business as 'Good Will'. Nevertheless it is something more
than good will in water works business, as it represents what might be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>more aptly described as 'connected good will', that is to say, the
acquisition of customers who have invested considerable sums in
actually connecting their premises with the plant of the company, and
provided appliances for the use of the water which it can deliver."</p>

<p class='c000'>The method advocated by Mr. Alvord as the most rational one for
computing this value is described as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is assumed that a new plant will be constructed, the inception
of which is coincident with the data of arbitration. Such new plant
is to be of an equal capacity with the older plant under consideration,
and a due allowance of time in which to construct this new plant,
and the necessary capital to be invested in it from time to time is
estimated. At the completion of this new imaginary plant, it is
assumed that it commences to obtain business in that community
from those who are not previously accustomed to the free use of public
water, except in a general way; that it is to require the business
ability and consequent increase in number of customers which the
earlier and older plant went through within the early years of its
existence. An assumption of the amount of business thus created for
each year for a period of years in advance is carefully computed and
estimated by the board of arbitration. The losses of interest upon
capital invested are duly fixed, as well as the first absence and later
addition of revenue from hydrant rentals, and a table is prepared
showing each year, the total business developed and the total losses, if
any. After this is completed a forecast is made of the business of the
older works for the same period of time in the future that it takes the
business of the new works to equal the business of the old works. If
the business of the old works is found to be a growing one it will be a
longer period that the new works will require to overtake it than will
be the case if the business of the older works is stationary or decreasing.
In general, the differences which might be called the debits and
credits of this new imaginary plant and the debits and credits of the
older working plant are reduced to their present worth at the time
of appraisement, and an estimate is made up which will adequately
represent the financial advantage which the old works (already fully
equipped and in running order and having a large number of profitable
customers) will have over the new works, where everything must
be built and customers secured.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is necessary in making this supposititious estimate of the new
plant to consider it in no way a competitor of the older works; there
is not supposed to be competition between the new and the old, but
it is left to the experience of the board of arbitration to consider how
long it would take the new company to build new works, and build up
business for the new works, until they have overtaken the business of
the old company should it continue to occupy the same territory."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>Mr. Alvord's description of his method has been quoted fully, as
it is an interesting one and has been often used. It is open to the
very decided objection that it is purely theoretical, a rational method
of computation, perhaps, but based on assumption throughout. It
may be said to be a method which is within the field of pure speculation.
Mr. Alvord, himself, says that where experience in financial
matters and the financial management of water-works is not brought
into the valuation, there is usually to be found guesses of the wildest
character. Professor Mead, in discussing Mr. Alvord's method and
agreeing that it is consistent and logical, says:</p>

<p class='c000'>"The method is by no means an exact one, and must necessarily lead
to a very great divergence in opinions as to the 'going value,' in
accordance with the assumptions on which it is based.... Its
very logic is an element of danger, for if clearly presented from a
biased standpoint to one previously unacquainted with its application,
and if accepted without careful analyses it may lead to very unjust
conclusions. If used, however, carefully and conscientiously with
the desire to do justice to all concerned, it is a valuable method of
estimating going value, and the only logical one with which the
speaker is familiar."</p>

<p class='c000'>In addition to the element of going or business value, Mr. Alvord
considers the franchise value, and presents two methods for its determination:</p>

<p class='c000'><em>First.</em>—The physical value, depreciation, and going value are entirely
neglected, and the entire valuation is fixed on the basis of its
earning power throughout the remaining life of the franchise and its
probable sale value.</p>

<p class='c000'>The probable net revenue for each year of franchise life must be
estimated and capitalized at a sum, which, if put at interest, would
pay such yearly revenue and extinguish itself at the end of the franchise
period. To this must be added the physical value of the plant at the
end of the franchise period.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Second.</em>—The cost of reproduction, depreciation, and present physical
value are ascertained, and the going value computed. Then it is determined
whether or not the net revenue is paying interest on a capitalized
value greater than that indicated by the sum of the physical and business
values. If such capitalized figure is less than this combined value,
there is, of course, no franchise value; if it is more, there is a franchise
value which should be determined by estimating, for the remaining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>years of the franchise, the excess income over and above that necessary
to cancel all obligations (including interest on the physical and business
values), and the reduction of these several sums to a basis of
present worth.</p>

<p class='c000'>A number of other articles and papers are listed in the Appendix.
Many of these are of great value and are well worth careful perusal,
but they offer no definite plan of valuation. Inasmuch as the general
principles involved in the valuation of a water-works plant and a
railroad plant are similar, it is advisable, in any exhaustive study of
the subject, to review the articles descriptive of water-works valuation,
and it is a matter of regret that greater consideration cannot be here
given to some of the points raised by such engineers as George H.
Benzenberg, Past-President, Am. Soc. C. E., Kenneth Allen, Arthur
L. Adams, Emil Kuichling, Members, Am. Soc. C. E., and others in
their various papers and discussions of this subject.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <cite>Railway Age</cite>, the <cite>Railroad Gazette</cite>, the <cite>Railroad Age Gazette</cite>,
and the <cite>Railway Age Gazette</cite> contain many editorials and articles on
the valuation of railroad properties. These are written mainly from
the standpoint of the railway official, and present many matters of
interest which are worthy of study prior to undertaking a large appraisal.
One series of articles in the <cite>Railway Age Gazette</cite><a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c003'><sup>[13]</sup></a> is a most
masterly argument, and it is to be regretted that the author has not
disclosed his identity.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Michigan valuation has been discussed in two papers by Mr.
Charles Hansel, whose connection with the work, as a member of the
Board of Review, gave him probably a more intimate knowledge of it
than any one else, not connected with the actual working organization,
who has undertaken to review the work. His first paper, published
in 1901,<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c003'><sup>[14]</sup></a> entitled, "What is the Value of a Railroad for Purposes of
Taxation?" is a discussion of the work of Professors Cooley and
Adams, written while the subject was fresh in his mind. His second
paper, an able argument for a Government valuation, appeared in
the <cite>North American Review</cite> in 1907. The one point to which special
attention is drawn is Mr. Hansel's astonishing misconception of Professor
Adams' plan of work. This misleading statement appears in
the first paper and is reiterated in the second. It is of such a character
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>that to pass it unchallenged would be doing great injustice to Professor
Adams. He states Professor Adams' plan as follows: Capitalize
net earnings and add to the present value of the physical appraisal
as found by Professor Cooley.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The result would be that in case the present value per mile as
determined by Professor Cooley is found to be $15,000, and the net
earnings by Professor Adams are found to be $1,000, this capitalized
at 5 per cent. would equal $20,000, and added to the present value
would make $35,000, which would be the sum upon which taxes were
to be levied. In other words, if the company actually earns $1,000 it
increases its value for purposes of taxation 20 times that amount. If,
however, instead of having a net earning of $1,000 it spends that sum
in improving the property, it has only increased its taxable property
by $1,000."</p>

<p class='c000'>This statement is not only inaccurate, but involves the other error
of assuming that the appraisal figure was to be used for taxation.
It was not. It was merely information to aid the legislature in framing
new taxation laws. The chief error, however, is in assuming that
Professor Adams added the value of the property, as determined by a
capitalization of net earnings (which <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i> is a well-recognized
method of valuation), to the value of the physical property. This
error probably is due to the flood of criticism which at the time was
aimed at any form of non-physical valuation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Professor Adams finds the net earning in Mr. Hansel's example to
be $1,000 per mile. From this, in the method actually used, he deducts
an annuity for the support of invested capital, which he assumes to be
the present value found by Professor Cooley. In the example given
by Mr. Hansel he would deduct 4% on $15,000, or $600 per mile,
leaving $400 per mile as surplus, or the earnings due to non-physical
elements of value. This, capitalized at 5%, would give $8,000 per
mile, which, added to Professor Cooley's figure of Present Value,
would make $23,000 per mile, instead of $35,000, as stated by Mr.
Hansel.</p>

<p class='c000'>The most recent criticism of the Michigan valuation work was in
an address<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c003'><sup>[15]</sup></a> before the New York Traffic Club in January, 1909, by
Mr. W. H. Williams, Third Vice-President of the Delaware and
Hudson Company. This address is devoted to an attack, not only on
the work of the Michigan appraisal, but on Professor Adams' work
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>and on the propriety of valuation work being undertaken for any
reason. The arguments advanced in this address are such that a discussion
of them becomes almost necessary in any complete review of
the Michigan work, and it contains so many statements which are
erroneous that it would hardly be permissible to pass them without
comment. The manifest impatience with all forms of governmental
interference with corporations, which so often characterizes the utterances
of prominent railway officials, appears in this paper to a marked
degree. After stating that the present agitation for a physical valuation
appears to be the result of a misconception, on the part of the
Interstate Commerce Commission, of Section 20 of the Act to Regulate
Commerce, and quoting Professor Adams' suggestion of an inquiry,
he says:</p>

<p class='c000'>"Subsequently, the desire of Governor Pingree to find a means of
increasing railway taxation in Michigan gave Professor Adams an
opportunity to experiment with his project within the limits of that
State."</p>

<p class='c000'>This is a direct imputation of an improper motive, not only to
Governor Pingree, but to Professor Adams. As stated elsewhere, the
investigation was to determine whether the railroads were paying
taxes on the same basis of valuation as other property in the State—an
absolutely proper proceeding. Professor Adams was associated
with the Michigan appraisal, but had no connection whatever with
the "physical valuation," to which such objection is taken, and his
appointment was made after the work of physical valuation had been
fully outlined and was well under way.</p>

<p class='c000'>The opening statement is followed by a brief <em>résumé</em> of the recommendations
of the Interstate Commerce Commission and President
Roosevelt, and of bills introduced in Congress, also by quotations from
Bulletin 21, describing the methods of valuation used in Michigan
and a showing that practically a similar basis was used in other
States. Mr. Williams then summarizes his objections to the Michigan
work:</p>

<p class='c000'>"(1) No allowance is made for discount on securities sold.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Discount is a partial capitalization of the commercial risk had in
making the investment, and it increases or decreases in proportion to
the probability of the earning power of money under existing conditions.
Not only is this practice justified by long-established commercial
usage, but also by judicial determination."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>The correctness of this position cannot be conceded on any grounds
of economics or accountancy. It is answered conclusively in an article,<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c003'><sup>[16]</sup></a>
elsewhere referred to, as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>"There is considerable diversity of opinion as regards the proper
treatment of discount on securities sold. There is a distinction between
bonds, representing corporate indebtedness and having a definite
limitation as to the time of their redemption, and share capital, representing
ownership and which as a rule is irredeemable. In relation
to the former there can be but one tenable view. If a company can
market its 50-year 4 per cent. bonds at 90 per cent. of par, it means
that the company's credit is on a 4½ per cent. basis; that it could
market a like security paying 4½ per cent. at par. If it elects to issue
at the lower rate it is merely sacrificing principal for the sake of a
reduction in the annual interest charge; in other words, it is pre-paying
interest which would accrue during the life of the issue. If
$10,000,000 par value were issued at 90 per cent., the discount would
amount to $1,000,000, and the saving in interest to $50,000 per year,
or $2,500,000 in 50 years. Obviously the company cannot claim the
privilege of capitalizing the discount, while thereby availing itself of
the reduction in interest. If such a course were legitimate in the case
of a 5 or 10 per cent. discount, it would be equally so if the discount
were 50 or 75 per cent., when the absurdity of the proposition would
be perfectly apparent. The somewhat general practice of prorating
the discount, as a charge against revenues, over the term of the obligation's
existence is sound; but this should be done, not in equal installments,
but on the basis of the appreciated value of the bond as it
approaches par at maturity. There is no apparent objection to charging
discount of this nature in a lump sum against an accumulated
surplus. The capitalization of discount on stocks, involving as it does
the introduction of fictitious values in capital assets, is wholly indefensible."</p>

<p class='c000'>The writer has failed to note any particular "judicial determination"
which approves of the charge of any such item to capital account.</p>

<p class='c000'>"(2) The interest during construction (3 per cent.) is less than a
fair and reasonable return on the investment."</p>

<p class='c000'>The amount actually paid out for interest on money used during
the period of construction will vary, of course, depending on the time
of construction and the way in which payments on construction materials
are made. On the basis of a rate of 6% per annum and construction
lasting one year, only a very small portion of the construction
cost will pay 6%, while the great items of rails, buildings, motive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>power, and equipment will be put into the work from 90 days to 10
months after the commencement of work, and will actually bear but
little interest. In the Michigan appraisal the assumption was made
that all work must be replaced in one year, and that on long roads
partial operation would commence as various sections of the line were
completed; and 3% was agreed on as a fair average, perhaps having
in mind Governor Pingree's "desire to increase railway taxation."
Some assumption must be made. This one, that long roads, covering
several years of construction work, are in Michigan put in partial
operation as soon as built, is not unreasonable. Such an assumption
clearly would not be proper in the case of long lines crossing mountains,
or involving such a class of construction as to make it impossible
to complete the property short of two or three years; and, in any
such cases, the interest charge should be made sufficient to cover.</p>

<p class='c000'>"(3) No allowance is made for working capital with which to carry
on the business."</p>

<p class='c000'>All the appraisals of physical property have been made on the
basis of securing a figure representing the cost of reconstructing the
property in the condition in which it existed on the date of the appraisal,
including only items properly chargeable to capital, cost of
road, and equipment. This is not such an item. The writer is of the
opinion, however, that it is a proper one to determine and include in
any report.</p>

<p class='c000'>"(4) No allowance is made for wear and tear of material during
the period of construction. Assuming eight years to be the life of a
tie, and three years the period of construction, a substantial percentage
of the period of usefulness is over before the road is in operation.
The use of the rails before the track is put in proper line and surface
hastens the time when they must be removed."</p>

<p class='c000'>This deterioration is a necessary incident to any construction
work. It has not been customary or usual to take account of it. To
add to the amount capitalized on account of this item would be manifestly
improper. The only way in which this could be cared for would
be in an adjustment of the depreciation reserve when raised to cover
that which takes place during the construction period. This reserve,
later in the address, is objected to by Mr. Williams as improper accounting:</p>

<p class='c000'>"(5) No allowance has been made for impact and adaptation.
After the line is placed in operation, each fill will sink 1 ft. for every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>10 ft. of height. The slope of cuts must be increased to prevent landslides
and washouts. The ballast will pound into the roadbed, necessitating
additional ballast to secure a standard cross-section."</p>

<p class='c000'>Part of this objection is covered by the item, "Appreciation of
Roadbed," discussed elsewhere. This, perhaps, is a proper item, but a
comparatively small one. One of the examples cited is clearly maintenance.
This objection is largely covered in the Michigan work by
the contingency item.</p>

<p class='c000'>"(6) A uniform price for earthwork was used, thus ignoring the
varying character of soil and length of haul."</p>

<p class='c000'>This is erroneous. On the Michigan appraisal prices were used
for earth, loose rock, and solid rock. There is practically no classification
in the Southern Peninsula of Michigan, or, in fact, on 90% of
the mileage of the State. The price used was not much out of the way
when considered as a fair average for the territory. The same was
apparently true of other appraisals. It would not be a proper figure
to use in an estimate based on 1909 prices, which are materially
greater than those obtaining in 1890-1900.</p>

<p class='c000'>"(7) A uniform price list for all materials was used, thus ignoring
the source of supply and cost of delivery to point of use."</p>

<p class='c000'>This, again, is not true. Differences were made between the Upper
and Lower Peninsulas; and an exhaustive study was made of rates to
different sections. It is believed that the prices adopted took all these
points fully into consideration. It is true that no effort was made to
use different unit prices as between counties, but, in a number of
cases, differences in prices were made for different sections of the
State, where either local conditions as to production of materials, or
traffic rates, seemed to warrant.</p>

<p class='c000'>"(8) No allowance was made for interference with work on account
of labor troubles, condition of the weather, etc., which would
vary materially in the different counties of the same state."</p>

<p class='c000'>True. Nor is such allowance ever made in actual construction, beyond
the contingency item. Such items are a frequent source of
annoyance, delay, and sometimes of expense, but an expense difficult
to separate and set up, and clearly belonging to contingencies.</p>

<p class='c000'>"(9) No allowance is made for carrying charges until such time as
the road was placed on a revenue basis."</p>

<p class='c000'>True; and such item is not a part of a physical appraisal.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>The foregoing nine points are classed as "among other things"
open to criticism. The next two quoted paragraphs are introduced to
indicate the "other things" as they appear. These are mainly non-physical
or intangible elements of value, which, under the method of
Professor Adams, are treated <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">en bloc</span></i>, and which, from their nature, it
would be impossible to set out and value separately; therefore, no
effort is made to answer them point by point, further than to say in
general that, if there is any value attaching to these items, it was
presumed to have been disclosed by the method of Professor Adams,
and to suggest further that had Professors Cooley and Adams had
such an advocate of intangible values ten years ago, their labors would
have been lightened, as all arguments by railway officials at that time
were against the use of any such elements of value in an appraisal.</p>

<p class='c000'>"No consideration has been given to the leasehold interests....
Therefore it will be seen there remains to be determined
many questions vitally affecting the value of the property without
regard to its value as a 'going concern.'</p>

<p class='c000'>"There should be no difference in the basis of arriving at the value,
as a 'going concern,' of the property of a railway and any industrial
establishment, nor should there be any difference in the basis of valuation
for taxation [exactly what Governor Pingree maintained] or
other purposes. There is common to both the value due to location,
good will, etc."</p>

<p class='c000'>While the remainder of the address in question contains no specific
criticisms of methods of valuation, it does go into a discussion of
sundry legal decisions; and conclusions are drawn quite at variance
with those set forth elsewhere in this paper. The thing most noticeable
in the entire address is the lack of a proper spirit of fairness, an
apparent inability to state fully and fairly the position of the men
whose views are being opposed, and an undue emphasis in quoting
some public official whose views coincide for the time being with the
theories which are being advocated. The fact that Mr. Williams
quotes from an address of Hon. Robert H. Shields, President of the
Michigan Tax Commission, a statement criticising the work of Professors
Cooley and Adams, illustrates the latter point.</p>

<p class='c000'>The statement is made again and again that the Michigan work
was a physical valuation; that no attempt was made to secure a "fair
value" (the language of the Courts), and that the value as a going
concern was not attempted to be given. In no case is the statement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>made that Professor Cooley had charge of the physical valuation in
Michigan, and that Professor Adams took this physical valuation, and,
under his method, treated it as one element, and with it and other
data derived from a study of the reports and earnings of the company,
undertook to determine a "non-physical," "intangible," "franchise,"
or "going concern" value, which included all tangible elements, and
which, added to the physical value, was assumed by Professor Adams
to give the true value. Had such a statement been fairly made, no
possible objection could be raised to the making of any number of
points against the correctness of the methods used by Professor Adams.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Certainly it cannot be denied that a road between New York and
Chicago, 950 miles in length, passing through a manufacturing district,
is of greater value than a road 1,200 miles in length, between
the same cities, but passing through a hilly and undeveloped territory
a portion of the distance, and through a farming section for a greater
portion of the remaining distance; yet the advocates of a physical
valuation would have us believe that there is no difference in the value
of the two if they can be reproduced to-day at the same cost."</p>

<p class='c000'>This statement is entirely unfair to every man who has been in
responsible charge of valuation work in recent years in the United
States. No theory has ever been favored by any honest-thinking
advocate of a valuation. In the first place, no interstate valuations
have ever been made, and no parallel case to the one assumed is to
be found, except for very short sections of roads, a very marked
instance having been referred to elsewhere in this paper. Such a condition
as assumed would be reflected in the earnings of the companies
to such an extent as to cause the non-physical element of Professor
Adams as used in Michigan to correct largely or wholly the inequality
and inaccuracy of the physical valuation; such at least was the theory,
and, if carried to its logical end by the use of negative non-physical
values, such would be the result.</p>

<p class='c000'>The final arguments of Mr. Williams' address are devoted to an
attack on the plan outlined by the Interstate Commerce Commission
for valuation, and on some of the accounting methods of the Commission—points
not proper to be discussed in this paper—but it is
difficult indeed to read them without noting the apparently studied
misrepresentation of the real attitude of Professor Adams and the
Commission, and the evident object of the entire address to create a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>wrong impression regarding what has been done, and a prejudice
against the men who have been engaged on State appraisal work and
those who advocate the appraisal of properties as a proper step in the
way of securing such information as will enable an intelligent consideration
of the great corporation problems that must be solved.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>The Determination of Elements of Value and Methods of <br /> Valuation by the Courts.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The preceding narrative of methods of appraisal work logically
leads up to the question: Will these methods that have been adopted
in various appraisal undertakings stand the test of the Courts? After
all, the final seal of approval must be stamped on a method by the
highest Courts before it can be said to be a definitely fixed and determined
principle for general use in valuation.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a careful perusal of many papers on this subject, quotations
from judicial decisions will be noted which are literally correct as far
as they go, but which are incomplete and often very misleading; and
often such incomplete quotations are presented as to convey an
entirely wrong impression of the full decision. In order that no such
charge may lie against this paper, the quotations given are full enough
to indicate clearly the intent of the Court, even at the expense of
undue length.</p>

<p class='c000'>An examination of all Federal and Supreme Court cases which
bear on the subject of property valuation has been made, and quotations
at length from some of the older cases, establishing precedent,
together with citations to more recent decisions, are submitted. It is
believed that the points of principle and method, in so far as they
have been determined by the highest Courts, are quite fully set forth.</p>

<p class='c000'>A study of the complete methods of the railroad valuation in Michigan,
in connection with these decisions, discloses the fact that they
comply with the requirements of the earlier cases, that all matters
affecting value be taken into consideration, and that in the more recent
decisions the detailed methods adopted in the Cooley physical appraisal
have been sustained as to very many points. In no case have any of
such methods been unfavorably criticized, and, while at this date the
Supreme Court has not squarely passed on the propriety of any
method for securing non-physical or intangible values, it has fully
sustained the general position of Professor Adams in several important
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>points. In addition to the complete examination of Federal cases,
certain very interesting and valuable State cases have been examined,
and some of them are quoted.</p>

<p class='c000'>These cases involve both matters of taxation and rate-making. They
cover railroads, water-works, gas-works, and other classes of public
service corporations, and clearly demonstrate the fact that any analysis
of the subject of property valuations must include all classes of corporations.
Rate-making and taxation in themselves are entirely separate
and distinct from valuation, which is a necessary preliminary
step in either undertaking. For this reason all references which are
not of special interest in the valuation part of the problem are
omitted.</p>

<p class='c000'>The case of Smyth <em>vs.</em> Ames (169 U. S., 466) was an action to
question the constitutionality of a statute of Nebraska establishing
rates. It is of great interest, and, based on the ruling of the Court
in this case, the appraiser in Washington and the appraisers in
Nebraska have undertaken to secure first cost as an element of value.
The decision holds that:</p>

<p class='c005'>(1) A railroad corporation is a person within the meaning of
the fourteenth amendment.</p>

<p class='c005'>(2) A State enactment establishing rates that will not admit the
carrier to earn such compensation as would be just to it and
to the public, would deprive such carrier of its property and
would be repugnant to the fourteenth amendment.</p>

<p class='c005'>(3) Rates established by a State cannot be so conclusively determined
by the legislature that they cannot become the subject
of judicial inquiry.</p>

<p class='c000'>The reasonableness of rates prescribed by a State for intra-state
business must be determined without reference to the interstate business
done by the carrier or the profits derived from that business.</p>

<p class='c000'>This paper is not concerned with the question of rates, which is
discussed at length in this decision. It is, however, of special interest
to note what the Court says in regard to the relation of the corporations
to the people, and to elements of value.</p>

<p class='c018'>"A railroad is a public highway, and none the less so because constructed
and maintained through the agency of a corporation deriving
its existence and powers from the State. Such a corporation was
created for public purposes. It performs a function of the State. Its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>authority to exercise the right of eminent domain and to charge tolls
was given primarily for the benefit of the public. It is under governmental
control, though such control must be exercised with due
regard to the constitutional guaranties for the protection of its property....
It cannot therefore be admitted that a railroad corporation
maintaining a highway under the authority of the State may
fix its rates with a view solely to its own interests and ignore the
rights of the public. But the rights of the public would be ignored if
rates for the transportation of persons or property on a railroad are
exacted without reference to the fair value of the property used for the
public, or the fair value of the services rendered, but in order simply
that the corporation may meet operating expenses, pay the interest
on its obligations, and declare a dividend to stockholders.</p>

<p class='c018'>"If a railroad corporation has bonded its property for an amount
that exceeds its fair value, or if its capitalization is largely fictitious,
it may not impose upon the public the burden of such increased rates
as may be required for the purpose of realizing profits upon such
excessive valuation or fictitious capitalization, and the apparent value
of the property and franchises used by a corporation, as represented
by its stocks, bonds, and obligations, is not alone to be considered when
determining the rates that may reasonably be charged."</p>

<p class='c000'>(The Court here quotes 164 U. S., 578, Covington and Lexington
Turnpike <em>vs.</em> Sanford.)</p>

<p class='c018'>"A corporation maintaining a public highway, although it owns the
property it employs for accomplishing public objects, must be held to
have accepted its rights, privileges, and franchises subject to the condition
that the government creating it, or the government within
whose limits it conducts its business, may by legislation protect the
people against unreasonable charges for the services rendered by it.
It cannot be assumed that any railroad corporation, accepting franchises,
rights, and privileges at the hands of the public, ever supposed
that it acquired, or that it was intended to grant to it, the
power to construct and maintain a public highway simply for its
benefit, without regard to the rights of the public. But it is equally
true that the corporation performing such public services, and the
people interested in its financial affairs have rights that may not be
invaded by legislative enactment in disregard of the fundamental
guaranty for the protection of property. The corporation may not be
required to use its property for the benefit of the public without
receiving just compensation for the services rendered by it. How such
compensation may be ascertained, and what are the necessary elements
in such inquiry, will always be an embarrassing question.</p>

<p class='c018'>"We hold, however, that the basis of all calculations as to the
reasonableness of rates to be charged by a corporation maintaining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>a highway under legislative sanction must be the fair value of the
property being used by it for the convenience of the public. And in
order to ascertain that value the original cost of construction, the
amount expended in permanent improvements, the amount and market
value of its bonds and stocks, the present as compared with the original
cost of construction, the probable earning capacity of the property
under particular rates established by the statute, the sum required to
meet operating expenses, are all matters for consideration, and are to
be given such weight as may be just and right in each case. We do
not say that there may not be other matters to be regarded in estimating
the value of the property. What the company is entitled to
ask is a fair return upon the value of that which it employs for the
public convenience. On the other hand, what the public is entitled to
demand is that no more be exacted from it for the use of a public
highway than the services rendered by it are reasonably worth."</p>

<p class='c000'>The body of this decision is quoted at length to show:</p>

<p class='c005'>First. That the Court reiterates the relation of the people to the
corporation, as defined by Covington and Lexington Turnpike
Road <em>vs.</em> Sanford (164 U. S., 578) and by Stone <em>vs.</em> Farmers'
Loan and Trust Company (116 U. S., 307).</p>

<p class='c005'>Second. That the basis for computing a fair rate is the fair value
of the property, which must be arrived at by a computation
or series of computations taking into account many different
factors.</p>

<p class='c005'>Third. That while the Court mentions certain things that may
serve as indices of value, which are to be taken into account
and given due weight, the Court does not outline or define any
method of arriving at a value, but does recognize it as an
embarrassing question.</p>

<p class='c005'>Fourth. That no such stress has been laid by the Court on original
cost as has been construed by some appraisers.</p>

<p class='c000'>The principles enunciated in Smyth <em>vs.</em> Ames are reiterated by the
Court in San Diego Land Company <em>vs.</em> National City (174 U. S., 739),
with the further ruling:</p>

<p class='c018'>"The contention of the appellant in the present case is that, in
ascertaining what are just rates, the Court should take into consideration
the cost of its plant; the cost per annum of operating the
plant, including interest paid on money borrowed and reasonably
necessary to be used in constructing the same; the annual depreciation
of the plant from natural causes resulting from its use; and a fair
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>profit to the Company over and above such charges for its services
in supplying the water to consumers, either by way of interest on the
money it has expended for the public use, or upon some other fair
and equitable basis. Undoubtedly, all these matters ought to be taken
into consideration and such weight given them, when rates are being
fixed, as under all the circumstances will be just to the company and
to the public. The basis of calculation suggested by the appellant
is, however, defective in not requiring the real value of the property
and the fair value in themselves of the services rendered to be taken
into consideration. What the company is entitled to demand, in order
that it may have just compensation, is a fair return upon the reasonable
value of the property at the time it is being used for the public.
The property may have cost more than it ought to have cost, and its
outstanding bonds for money borrowed, and which went into the plant,
may be in excess of the real value of the property. So that it cannot
be said that the amount of such bonds should in every case control the
question of rates, although it may be an element in the inquiry as
to what is, all the circumstances considered, just to both the company
and the public."</p>

<p class='c000'>In the case of Columbus Southern Railway <em>vs.</em> Wright (151 U. S.,
479), the Court quotes approvingly from Franklin Company <em>vs.</em> Railroad
(12 Lea (Tenn.), 521-537-538-539), and shows that the doctrine
quoted had already been enunciated by the Supreme Court in the
State Railroad Tax Cases (92 U. S., 575-607). The Court quotes as
follows:</p>

<p class='c018'>"The property of a railroad company for purposes of taxation consists
of its realty, its local personalty, its rolling stock, its choses in
action, and its franchises. The franchise is a privilege conferred by
the charter of incorporation, namely the right to exercise all the powers
granted in the mode prescribed for the purpose of profit. It is a unit
not confined to any one county in which it may be exercised.</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c018'>"Obviously, after ascertaining the value of the entire franchise in
the State as a unit, no more approximate or just division of this value
can be made for purposes of taxation than to allot it among the counties
through which the track runs in proportion of the entire length
of track in the county to the entire length of track in the State....</p>

<p class='c018'>"The roadway itself of a railroad depends for its value upon the
traffic of the company and not merely upon the narrow strip of land
appropriated for the use of the road, and the bars and cross-ties thereon.
The value of a roadway at any given time is not the original cost, nor,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a fortiori</span></i>, its ultimate cost after years of expenditure in repairs and
improvements. On the other hand, its value cannot be determined by
ascertaining the value of the land included in the roadway assessed at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>the market price of adjacent lands, and adding the value of the cross-ties,
rails, and spikes. The value of land depends largely upon the
use to which it is put and the character of the improvements upon it."</p>

<p class='c000'>The mileage basis of apportionment is sustained in the following
and other cases:</p>

<table class='table13' summary='mileage basis of apportionment'>

<p class='c000'>Therefore this basis of division of values between territorial units
appears to be well established by precedent. This is in a measure unfortunate,
as certain classes of property cannot be apportioned equitably
in this way, unless the value of a railroad be determined, and then
that value allocated between different territorial units in proportion
to mileage, without any regard to the location of any structure
or series of structures in any State or county, the track-mileage basis
must be looked upon as a method of apportionment which is subject
to modification or which will lead to error.</p>

<p class='c000'>In an Indiana tax case, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago, and St.
Louis Railway <em>vs.</em> Backus (154 U. S., 444), the late Justice Brewer, of
the Supreme Court, in handing down the judgment, said:</p>

<p class='c018'>"The true value of a line of railroad is something more than an
aggregation of the values of the separate parts of it, operated separately.
It is the aggregate of those values plus that arising from a connected
operation of the whole, and each part of the road contributes
not merely the value arising from its independent operation, but its
mileage proportion of that flowing from a continuous and connected
operation of the whole.... The value of property results from
the use to which it is put, and varies with the profitableness of that
use, past, present and prospective, actual and anticipated. There is no
pecuniary value outside that which results from such use....</p>

<p class='c018'>"In the nature of things it is practically impossible, at least
in respect to railroad property, to divide its value and determine how
much is caused by one use to which it is put and how much by
another. Take the case before us, it is impossible to disintegrate the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>value of that portion of the road within the State of Indiana and
determine how much of that value springs from its use in doing
interstate business and how much from its use in doing business
wholly within the State. An attempt to do so would be entering upon
a mere field of uncertainty and speculation."</p>

<p class='c000'>In the Michigan cases, the principal one being Michigan Central
Railroad <em>vs.</em> Powers (201 U. S., 245), the question of method of valuation
was not passed on by the Courts for the reason that, after the
evidence was in, and during the argument, counsel for the railroad
admitted that the Cooley valuation was as correct a figure as it was
possible to secure under then existing conditions, methods and rates
of taxation being the issue.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is thus seen that the Supreme Court of the United States was
not, in any of the earlier cases, required to pass squarely on the
propriety of any method of arriving at a "fair value," and consequently
had not, prior to 1909, defined any hard-and-fast rules of
procedure in determining such value. The Circuit Courts have passed
on kindred questions in a few cases, among which San Diego Land
and Town Company <em>vs.</em> National City (74 Fed., 83), and San Diego
Land and Town Company <em>vs.</em> Jasper (110 Fed., 714) hold as above,
and cite most of the cases referred to. In the latter case the Court
says:</p>

<p class='c018'>"The actual value of such property obviously depends upon a variety
of considerations—among them the actual and prospective number of
consumers—and is no more unchangeable than the value of any other
kind of property."</p>

<p class='c000'>As an illustration, there is cited the effect of a year's drouth on an
irrigation plant as temporarily affecting the value of property.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the case of Cotting <em>vs.</em> Kansas City Stock Yards (82 Fed., 839)
the Circuit Court touches on one very interesting argument, in the
light of some of the methods of valuation advocated by railway managers
and some of the criticisms of recent valuation work.</p>

<p class='c018'>"Different methods of estimating the value of property may properly
be employed when it is valued for different purposes. When a valuation
is placed on property which has become affected by a public use,
for the purpose of ascertaining whether the maximum rate of compensation
fixed by law for its use is reasonable or otherwise, it is
obvious that the income derived therefrom by the owner before it
was subjected to legislative control cannot always be accepted as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>proper test of value because the compensation which the owner charged
for its use may have been excessive and unreasonable. Again, when
property has been capitalized by issuing stock, neither the market
value nor the par value of the stock can be accepted in all cases as a
proper criterion of value, because the stock may not represent the
money actually invested, and furthermore because the property may
have been capitalized mainly with reference to its income producing
capacity, on the assumption that it is ordinary private property which
the owner may use as he thinks proper without being subject to
legislative control. On the other hand, however, when property is
valued for the purpose last stated, it is clear that the owner thereof
is entitled to the benefit of any appreciation in value above the
original cost and the cost of improvements, which is due to what may
be termed natural causes. If improvements made in the vicinity of the
property, the growth of city or town where it is located, the building
of railroads, the development of the surrounding country and other
like causes, give property an increased value, the owner cannot be deprived
of such income by legislative action which prevents him from realizing
an income commensurate with the enhanced value of his property."</p>

<p class='c000'>The language of the late Judge Brewer, sitting as one of the
circuit judges in the case of National Water-Works Company <em>vs.</em>
Kansas City (62 Fed., 853), is definite as to the necessity of taking
into account some elements of intangible value, and is here quoted as
giving the views of this eminent jurist:</p>

<p class='c018'>"The difficult question, however, still remains; and that is, what
is the 'fair and equitable value,' which by the statute and ordinance
the city is to pay for the water-works? * * * We are not satisfied
that either method, by itself, will show that which under all the
circumstances can be adjudged the 'fair and equitable value.'</p>

<p class='c018'>"Capitalization of earnings will not, because that implies continuance
of earnings, and a continuance of earnings rests upon a franchise
to operate the water-works. The original cost of construction cannot
control, for original cost and present value are not equivalent terms.
Nor would the mere cost of reproducing the water-works plant be a
fair test, because that does not take into account the value which
flows from the established connections between the pipes and buildings
of the city. * * * A complete system of water-works, such as
the company has, without a single connection between the pipes in the
streets and the buildings of the city would be a property of much less
value than the system connected as it is with so many buildings and
earning, in consequence thereof, the money which it does earn. The
fact that it is a system in operation, not only with a capacity to
supply the city but actually supplying many buildings, in the city—not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>only with a capacity to earn but actually earning—make it true
that the 'fair and equitable value' is something in excess of the cost of
reproduction."</p>

<p class='c000'>The foregoing authorities cover practically all the older cases in
the Federal Courts. These cases have been examined, and such of the
subject matter has been quoted as would show the conclusions of the
Courts as to what constitute the various elements of true value. The
latest Federal decision bearing on the subject, and in many ways the
most replete with argument, is the case of Consolidated Gas Company
<em>vs.</em> City of New York (157 Fed., p. 849), which was decided in
December, 1907.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this case the valuation was determined by the master:</p>

<p class='c005'>1.—A valuation of tangible assets, consisting of real estate, plant,
mains, services, meters and miscellaneous equipment, and the
property of subsidiary companies, the whole aggregating
$63,357,000. Of this an allowance of $3,616,000 was made by
the master for working capital, and this entire amount was
treated as tangible property.</p>

<p class='c005'>2.—Finally, an intangible value of
0,000,000 was assigned by
him to the franchise and good will.</p>

<p class='c000'>Objections were raised, as follows:</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>A</em>) Land values represent no original investment by the Company,
do not indicate land especially appropriate for the
manufacture of gas, and increase the apparent assets without
increasing the earning power.</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>B</em>) The values of physical property are not original cost, but are
cost of reproduction less depreciation.</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>C</em>) Some of the property cost more than new articles of the same
kind at the time of inquiry. Some are of designs not now
favored by the scientific and manufacturing world.</p>

<p class='c000'>The disputed questions involved, as far as tangible property is
concerned, were:</p>

<p class='c005'>1.—Whether the values ascribed to the several enumerated items
are based on competent and persuasive evidence.</p>

<p class='c005'>2.—Whether the method of valuation pursued by the master is in
accordance with law.</p>

<p class='c005'>3.—Whether the items of property are "employed" (in the legal
signification of the word) in the production of gas.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>The first, a question of fact, is found affirmatively, and the evidence
was found to be competent.</p>

<p class='c000'>The second question is one of law, and, quoting from the cases
cited in this paper, the Court holds as follows:</p>

<p class='c018'>"This method of valuation correct * * * upon reason it seems
clear that in solving this equation the plus and minus quantities
should be equally considered and appreciation and depreciation treated
alike.... The value of the investment of any manufacturer,
in plant, factory, or goods, or all three, is what his possessions would
sell for upon a fair transfer from a willing vendor to a willing buyer,
and it can make no difference that such a value is affected by the efforts
of himself or others, by whim or fashion, or (what is really the same
thing) by the advance of land values in the opinion of the buying
public. It is equally immaterial that such value is affected by difficulties
of reproduction. If it be true that a pipe line under the New
York of 1907 is worth more than was a pipe line under the city of
1827, then the owner thereof owns that value, and that such advance
arose wholly or partly from difficulties of duplication created by the
city itself is a matter of no moment. Indeed, the causes of either appreciation
or depreciation are alike unimportant if the fact of value be
conceded or proved; but that ultimate inquiry is oftentimes so difficult
that original cost, and reasons for changes in value, become legitimate
subjects of investigation as checks upon expert estimates, or bookkeeping,
inaccurate and perhaps intentionally misleading. * * *</p>

<p class='c018'>"The so-called money value of real or personal property is but a
conveniently short method of expressing present potential usefulness,
and 'investment' becomes meaningless if construed to mean what the
thing invested in cost generations ago. Property, whether real or personal,
is only valuable when useful. Its usefulness commonly depends
on the business purposes to which it is or may be applied. Such business
is a living thing, and may flourish or wither, appreciate or depreciate;
but, whatever happens, its present usefulness, expressed in financial
terms, must be its value. * * * It is not to be inferred that
any American government intended when granting a franchise, not
only to regulate the business transacted thereunder, and reasonably to
limit the profits thereof, but to prevent the valuation of purely private
property in the ordinary economic manner, and the property now
under consideration is as much private property as are the belongings
of any private citizen. Nor can it be inferred that such government
intended to deny the application of economic laws to valuation of
increments earned or unearned, while insisting on the usual results
thereof in the case of equally unearned and possibly unmerited depreciation.</p>

<p class='c018'>"I think the method of valuation applied by the report to land,
plant, mains, services, and meters lawful. To 'working capital, Coke
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>and Coal Company, and Astoria' the above considerations are not
applicable, and these items will be treated separately."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Court's review of the third question raises no points of special
interest as to valuation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The question as to amount of "working capital" is taken up, and
that term is defined as:</p>

<p class='c018'>"The amount of cash necessary for the safe and convenient transaction
of a business, having regard to the owner's ordinary outstandings
both payable and receivable, the ordinary condition of his stock,
or supplies in hand, the natural risk of his business, and the condition
of his credit; and unless these matters, and perhaps others, be
looked into, no comparison can be drawn between one business and
another, or even between those of the same general nature."</p>

<p class='c000'>In this instance it is of interest to note that the Court reduced
the "working capital" from $3,616,000 to $1,616,000.</p>

<p class='c000'>Perhaps the most novel and interesting part of this decision is that
dealing with the intangible elements of value. The master was unable
to separate the two elements, good will and franchise value, but gave
their combined value.</p>

<p class='c018'>"From the testimony I think it apparent that what is here meant
by good will is the organization of complainant, long established, and
doubtless well manned and equipped. Such organization is clearly
of value, because without it neither tangible nor intangible property
can be profitably managed. Yet the organization itself is but a method
of utilizing that which is invested, it is really dependent for its existence
and continuance upon the franchise, without which there can be
no useful organization. Tangible property has a certain value entirely
apart from franchise or right to continue business, but good will in
the sense of the organization for the business of furnishing gas, can
have no existence whatever apart or detached from the franchise
conferring the necessary privilege. Would any one think of capitalizing
good will of this kind and distributing its assumed value in the
shape of new shares among stockholders new or old? I think the most
ingenious financier could not imagine such a proceeding, and, if this
good will be not property capable of such capitalization and distribution,
I do not think it property capable of capitalization as against the
State.</p>

<p class='c018'>"Finally, this claim of good will seems to forget that for many
years the price and distribution of complainant's gas has been regulated
by law. A citizen is entitled to have a clean street before his house
because he pays taxes, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">inter alia</span></i>, for that purpose. He is much more
plainly entitled to have complainant's gas in his house because the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>company must give it to him if he pays for it. I think it apparent
that the conceivable good will of a gas company in this city is about
equal to that of the street-cleaning department of the municipal
government."</p>

<p class='c000'>Is a public service corporation entitled to add the value of its franchise
to the assets from which a fair return may lawfully be demanded?
This question is taken up and discussed exhaustively by the Court
(157 Fed., 872 to 879), and while it is clear in reading his judgment
that he does not believe it sound doctrine to invest a franchise with
value, yet, after citing a large number of cases, he reaches the conclusion
that he is "compelled" to consider franchises, not only as property,
but as productive and inherently valuable property, and to add
their value, if ascertainable, to complainant's capital account before
declaring the rate of return.</p>

<p class='c000'>This case went to the Supreme Court of the United States, where,
under the title Willcox <em>vs.</em> Consolidated Gas Company (212 U. S., 19),
citation is made to many cases in connection with the matter of franchise
value. The decision of the Court is:</p>

<p class='c018'>"The value of real estate and plant is to a considerable extent a
matter of opinion, and the same may be said of personal estate when
not based upon the actual cost of material and construction. Deterioration
of the value of the plant, mains, and pipes is also to some extent
based upon opinion. All these matters make questions of value somewhat
uncertain."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Supreme Court permitted the tangible values found by the
lower Court to stand. It concurred with the lower Court in that it was
not a case for a valuation of good will. It concurred with the lower
Court in holding that the company was entitled to the benefit of any
increase in tangible values, and that such increases should appear in the
appraisal. It did not agree with the Court in the increase of franchise
value above that which was capitalized in 1884, with the consent
of the State of New York, and reduced the franchise value figure to
$7,781,000. On this basis, the estimated return, under the new rate on
the valuation of $55,612,435, was 5½%, which rate, in view of all the
circumstances, is held to be not confiscatory and to be a not unreasonable
return on the investment. The franchise value, as commented on
in these cases, is referred to at considerable length in the following
pages.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>On January 4th, 1909, the case of Knoxville <em>vs.</em> Water Company
(212 U. S., 1) was decided. This, in some respects, is of greater value
to the engineer than any others cited, in its determination of methods.
In this the appraisement of the tangible property was made in minute
detail, the sum of $10,000 was added for "organization, promotion,
etc.," and $60,000 for "going concern."</p>

<p class='c018'>"The latter sum we understand to be an expression of the added
value of the plant as a whole over the sum of the values of its
component parts, which is attached to it because it is in active and
successful operation and earning a return. We express no opinion as
to the propriety of these two items in the valuation of the plant for the
purpose for which it was valued in this case, but leave that question
to be considered when it necessarily arises. We assume without deciding,
that these items were properly added in this case. This valuation
was determined by the master by ascertaining what it would cost to
reproduce the existing plant as a new plant. The cost of reproduction
is one way of ascertaining the present value of a plant like that
of a water company, but that test would lead to obviously incorrect
results if the cost of reproduction is not diminished by the depreciation
which has come from age and use.... The cost of reproduction
is not always a fair measure of the present value of a plant which
has been in use for many years. The items composing the plant
depreciate in value from year to year in a varying degree. Some
pieces of property, like real estate for instance, depreciate not at all,
and sometimes, on the other hand, appreciate. But the reservoirs, the
mains, the service pipes, structures upon real estate, stand-pipes,
pumps, boilers, meters, tools, and appliances of every kind begin to
depreciate with more or less rapidity from the moment of their first
use. It is not easy to fix at any given time the amount of depreciation
of a plant whose component parts are of different ages with different
expectations of life. But it is clear that some substantial allowance
for depreciation ought to have been made in this case.</p>

<p class='c018'>"The company's original case was based upon an elaborate analysis
of the cost of construction. To arrive at the present value of the
plant large deductions were made on account of the depreciation.
This depreciation was divided into complete depreciation and incomplete
depreciation. The complete depreciation represented that part
of the original plant which through destruction or obsolescence had
actually perished as useful property. The incomplete depreciation
represented the impairment in value of the parts of the plant which
remained in existence and were continued in use. It was urgently
contended that in fixing upon the value of the plant upon which the
company was entitled to earn a reasonable return, the amounts of
complete and incomplete depreciation should be added to the present
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>value of the surviving parts. The Court refused to approve this
method, and we think properly refused. A water plant with all
its additions begins to depreciate in value from the moment of its
use. Before coming to the question of profit at all the company is
entitled to earn a sufficient sum annually to provide not only for current
repairs but for making good the depreciation and replacing the
parts of the property when they come to the end of their life. The
company is not bound to see its property gradually waste, without
making provision out of earnings for its replacement. It is entitled to
see that from earnings the value of the property invested is kept
unimpaired, so that at the end of any given term of years the original
investment remains as it was at the beginning. It is not only the
right of the company to make such a provision but it is its duty
to its bond and stockholders, and, in the case of a public service corporation
at least, its plain duty to the public. If a different course
were pursued the only method of providing for replacement of property
which has ceased to be useful would be the investment of new
capital and the issue of new bonds or stock.... If, however,
a company fails to perform this plain duty and to exact sufficient
returns to keep the investment unimpaired, whether this is the result
of unwarranted dividends upon over issues of securities, or of omission
to exact proper prices for the output, the fault is its own. When,
therefore, a public regulation of its prices comes under question,
the true value of the property then employed for the purpose of
earning a return cannot be enhanced by a consideration of the errors
of the management which have been committed in the past."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Court holds that there was error in only considering the operations
of the company for a period of one year, and that this should
have extended to enough time to remove danger of abnormal business
conditions and observe the effects of certain ordinances.</p>

<p class='c000'>The decision of the Supreme Court, in the Omaha Water-Works
case, decided on May 31st, 1910 (<cite>Supreme Court Reporter</cite>, July 1st,
1910), is of general interest in its discussion of the procedure of
appraisers in making a water-works appraisal, and in the distinction
drawn between appraisals and arbitrations; but it does not touch on
appraisal methods or elements of value, except to discuss "going
values." The language of Judge Lurton on this point is as follows:</p>

<p class='c018'>"The option to purchase excluded any value on account of unexpired
franchise, but it did not limit the value to the bare bones of
the plant, its physical properties, such as its lands, its machinery, its
water-pipes or settling reservoirs, nor to what it would take to reproduce
each of its physical features. The value, in equity and justice,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>must include whatever is contributed by the fact of the connection
of the items making a complete and operating plant.</p>

<p class='c018'>"The difference between a dead plant and a live one is a real value,
and is independent of any franchise to go on, or any mere good will
as between such a plant and its customers. That kind of good will,
as suggested in Willcox <em>vs.</em> Consolidated Gas Company (212 U. S.,
19), is of little or no commercial value when the business is, as here,
a natural monopoly, with which the customer must deal, whether he
will or not. That there is a difference between even the cost of duplication,
less depreciation, of the elements making up the water company
plant and the commercial value of the business as a going
concern is evident. Such an allowance was upheld in National Water
Works Company <em>vs.</em> Kansas City (62 Fed., 853), where the opinion
was by Mr. Justice Brewer. [This decision is quoted in the foregoing
pages.] We can add nothing to the reasoning of the learned Justice,
and shall not try to. That case has been approved and followed in
Gloucester Water Supply Company <em>vs.</em> Gloucester (179 Mass., 365,
and 60 N. E., 977), and Norwich Gas and Electric Company <em>vs.</em>
Norwich (76 Conn., 565). No such question was considered in Knoxville
Water Company (212 U. S., 1) or in Willcox <em>vs.</em> Consolidated
Gas Company (212 U. S., 19). Both cases were rate cases and did not
concern the ascertainment of value under contracts of sale."</p>

<p class='c000'>The writer does not read into the language of this decision an
approval of a separate element of value to be called "going concern
value" or "going value" in addition to other non-physical values, but
rather a recognition of the fact that certain non-physical elements of
value, by whatever name they may be called, must be taken into
account in arriving at the fair and equitable final figure of value of a
live and operating concern for the purpose of carrying out a contract
of sale.</p>

<p class='c000'>It appears to be doubtful whether the Court can be construed as
approving such an element of value in rate cases.</p>

<p class='c000'>It thus appears that the United States Courts have laid down a
few rules, which may be regarded as fixed and definite and must be
followed, but that many important questions have not yet been
decided. The value to be determined must be a "fair value" of the
property being used for the convenience of the public. The par value
of stocks and bonds may not alone be considered (although it may be
considered), the market value of stocks and bonds, original cost plus
cost of additions, the probable earning capacity, the cost of reproduction,
depreciation, appreciation, all these, and any others that will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>throw light on the "fair value" must be taken into account and given
the weight to which they are entitled. Any fictitious book values due
to over-issues of stock and bonds are to be given no weight, but the
appraisal must give the fair value, in the light of all the facts, of the
property in actual use at the time of the appraisal.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are several decisions of the State Supreme Courts which
discuss these subjects, but an examination of a number of these gives
practically nothing more, in the way of definite conclusions as to
method, than has been cited. Perhaps the most complete and painstaking
consideration of appraisal problems by any Court was that
given by Judge Savage of the Supreme Court of Maine (97 Maine,
185, and 99 Maine, 371). These were neither rate cases nor taxation
cases, but proceedings under statute to require from the Court instructions
to a board of appraisers appointed to value the plants. In the
later or Brunswick case, Judge Savage elucidates a number of points
left not altogether clear in the Waterville case. The Brunswick
decision contains some interesting views on "going value," and the
Court's remarks on the general difficulties in making rules for an
appraisement are exactly to the point:</p>

<p class='c018'>"There are many difficulties, if not dangers, in attempting to
formulate rules which are to be applied to facts not yet ascertained.
While it may be easy enough to state rules in the abstract, it is much
more satisfactory in an opinion of the court, to express them in terms
which are applicable to the facts in the precise case in hand....
It must be always understood that our answers to these questions are
intended to be given only in the most general and comprehensive
terms, which may, or may not, be found to be fitted to the facts which
may subsequently be developed. No other course would be wise or
safe.... A public service property may or may not have
a value independent of the amount of rates, which for the time being
may be changed. A public service company may, under some circumstances,
be required to perform its services at rates prohibitive of a
fair return to its stockholders, considering their property as an investment
merely....</p>

<p class='c018'>"Now, what is the property which the district has taken by power
of eminent domain? In the first place it is a structure, pure and
simple, consisting of pipes, pumps, engines, land rights, and water
rights. As a structure, it has value independent of any use, or right
to use, where it is, a value probably much less than it cost, unless it
can be used where it is, that is, unless there is a right to use it. Nevertheless,
it has value as a structure. But, more than this, it is a structure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>in actual use, a use remunerative to some extent. It has customers,
it is actually engaged in business, it is a going concern. The
value of the structure is enhanced by the fact that it is used in, and
in fact is essential to, a going concern business. We speak sometimes
of a going concern value as if it is, or could be, separate and distinct
from structure value—so much for structure and so much for going
concern. But this is not an accurate statement. The going concern
part of it has no existence except as a characteristic of the structure.
If no structure, no going concern. If a structure in use, it is a structure
whose value is affected by the fact that it is in use. There is only
one value. It is the value of the structure as being used. That is all
there is of it."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Court then argues that, as the structure is being used under
authority and by virtue of franchises, it is more valuable. The franchise,
however, is limited; other and competing franchises may be
granted; a franchise may exist entirely independent of a structure.
He holds that the structure is more valuable with the franchise.</p>

<p class='c018'>"It is a structure in actual use, and with a right on the part of
the owner to use it and to charge reasonable rates to customers for
services rendered. It is threefold in discussion but it is single in
substance."</p>

<p class='c000'>This case is largely taken up with a discussion of the reasonableness
of rates which furnish a basis for the estimate of value. There
is no specific attempt to describe methods of procedure. That is left
to the appraisers. These two Maine Cases, together with a valuable
paper<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c003'><sup>[17]</sup></a> thereon by Leonard Metcalf, M. Am. Soc. C. E., constitute an
extremely valuable addition to the literature of appraisements.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is clear, from a study of all the cases referred to in this paper,
that the Courts have laid down a line of precedent which is equitable
and just, that the interests of both public and corporations will be safeguarded,
and that the likelihood of any unfair or improper valuations
passing the scrutiny of the Supreme Court is but remote.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>Physical Values and Methods for Their Determination.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>All the foregoing narrative of methods adopted in recent valuations,
review of judicial opinions, and comment on the expressed
opinions of various engineers and railway officials, is presented as
being proper and necessary to support the contention that the Michigan
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>valuation, while not the first appraisal work, was the first valuation
work of large magnitude undertaken by any State; that it was a work
which established many precedents; and that the complete discussion
of methods and principles in connection with and following this
appraisal has given it probably a greater general value than any
similar undertaking. The Wisconsin work, which immediately followed
that of Michigan, was along lines similar to those of the Michigan
physical valuation, and carried the work forward, adding to and
strengthening certain of its features. Without any impropriety, it
may be claimed that these two appraisals have laid down the general
lines on which this class of engineering effort will be largely directed
in the future.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is desirable, in closing this paper, to indicate such general
methods of procedure in valuation practice as may be said to have been
thoroughly established by precedent, and to present such argument as
will support the contention that such methods are proper.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fact has been emphasized, again and again, by every writer on
the subject, that problems of this class are not capable of exact mathematical
solution; that, no matter how much care may be exercised in
the execution of the work, the result is tempered by the personal judgment
of the men engaged on it, and that only when it is executed by
men of experience, sound judgment, and high moral worth can it have
a definite, final, and just result.</p>

<p class='c000'>This feature of appraisal work cannot be too strongly emphasized.
The value of the work depends on the character of the men doing it,
their experience in design, construction, and operation of properties,
and their absolute fairness and freedom from prejudice.</p>

<p class='c000'>That there will be many large valuations undertaken in the near
future, there appears to be no doubt. These valuations will be made as
a necessary preliminary to three classes of corporate control: rate-making,
taxation, and the regulation of capitalization.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Courts hold that the value must be "the fair value of the
property used for the public," and that the corporation:</p>

<p class='c018'>"may not impose upon the public the burden of such increased
rates as may be required for the purpose of realizing profits upon
[such] excessive valuation or fictitious capitalization." (Smyth <em>vs.</em>
Ames.)</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>This language is repeated, again and again, so that it is clear that
any valuation, to be sustained by the Courts, should:</p>

<p class='c000'><em>1.</em>—Be based on a careful study and analysis of all the information
applicable to the case in hand; and</p>

<p class='c000'><em>2.</em>—That it must separate the various elements so that every step
of the work may be reviewed and supported.</p>

<p class='c000'>Public interest demands that, in any valuation, certain figures
shall appear which shall show the amount of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">bona fide</span></i> capital actually
existing in the property at the date of appraisal.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fact that a given amount of money was invested in building a
railroad in 1880, and that certain other sums were spent for additions
in subsequent years, does not necessarily indicate that these amounts
of capital will still be found in the property in 1910.</p>

<p class='c000'>The removal of timber from surrounding lands, the destruction of
industries and the removal of tracks leading thereto, the destruction
of equipment and facilities, the depreciation in value of adjacent
property, along with wear and tear, and obsolescence, have gone to
effect the destruction or loss of capital on many Michigan railroads.
The case in 212 U. S., 1, clearly directs that the valuation must not
take into account this destroyed capital, but must return a "fair value
of the property as it is."</p>

<p class='c000'>On the other hand, the amount of money actually spent in producing
a given property in the past may be far below the present value.
The appreciation of value of lands by reason of development of cities
and growth of industries, the increase in cost of the materials entering
its construction, and many other causes, may lead to an appreciation
of the value of the property, and this appreciation should appear in
the valuation and the company be entitled to the benefit of it. It is
in the nature of an increase of the investment, and should appear
as capital.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is clear that there are two classes of elements of value in the
final value of a public service property: those which are physical, and
those which are intangible. There are various of the physical elements
of value which are not material or susceptible of inventory, but which,
nevertheless, attach themselves to the physical property, are capable of
determination, within reasonable limits of certainty, and should be
taken into account and computed as physical property.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the subsequent discussion of physical and intangible values, it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>attempted to differentiate between such elements as should attach to
the physical value, or capital remaining in the plant, and the purely
intangible or franchise values.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is contended by the writer:</p>

<p class='c000'>That the Physical Value, or present value of the physical property,
should fairly represent the actual capital invested in the property at
the date of appraisal; that it should be made up of the sum of the
various elements which constitute the cost of reproducing the property
together with any appreciation which may have been added to any of
them, less all depreciation.</p>

<p class='c000'>That the Non-Physical Value is the difference between the "fair
value" as defined by the Courts, or the reasonable value of the property
as a business or producing property, and the physical value, or actual
present worth; and that the only proper method for determining such
values involves a study of income accounts.</p>

<p class='c000'>This Non-Physical Value may be: positive, or a value in excess
of the physical property, or negative, or less than the physical value.
In the case of a property having a negative intangible value, a deduction
should be made from the physical value.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is further contended that, in making the physical appraisal, the
purpose of the appraisal should not be permitted to modify the figures.
The resultant figure should be the same, whether it is to be used as a
basis for assessment, rate-making, or limitation of capitalization. It
should be an engineering estimate of the amount of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">bona fide</span></i> capital
still remaining in the property, or of the complete cost of reproduction
under existing conditions, less depreciation. This figure is definite,
within reasonable limits, and it cannot be conceded that it is permissible
to vary it, submitting one result as a physical value for
taxation, and another and different result as a present physical valuation
for rate-making.</p>

<p class='c000'>There may be some question as to the propriety of using non-physical
values for certain ultimate ends; in fact, the Supreme Court,
in the Omaha and Knoxville water cases, clearly indicates that they
must not be used for certain purposes; but, in any case, to furnish
information, this element of value should be determined, and, as in the
case of physical values, it should be an unchangeable figure<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c003'><sup>[18]</sup></a> and should
represent the difference between the worth of the actual physical property
and the final business value of the property considered as an
earning proposition.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>It is not necessary to go minutely into detail as to the various
steps to be taken in making the appraisal of physical property. Each
appraisal will offer some problems peculiar to itself, and no general
set of rules can be laid down which will be applicable to all cases. It
is deemed sufficient to call attention to general matters of major importance
and to refer to some points which have not been mentioned in
the preceding narrative, omitting argument in the case of such as
have there been fully discussed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The distinction should be kept in mind that any element of value
which belongs to the property by reason of its physical existence is
classed as an element of physical value. The property is considered
as an operating property in the sense that it is reproduced complete,
ready to operate; and any expense, or any element of value needed to
complete it, is an element of the physical value, but any value arising
as a result of surplus earning power, any good-will value, going-concern
value, or value due to established business, strategic location,
favorable traffic arrangements, etc., should be considered as intangible
values.</p>

<p class='c000'>The valuation of physical property is naturally divided into four
parts:</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>I.</dt>
    <dd>—The preliminary study,
    </dd>
    <dt>II.</dt>
    <dd>—The field inspection,
    </dd>
    <dt>III.</dt>
    <dd>—The computation,
    </dd>
    <dt>IV.</dt>
    <dd>—The preparation of the final figure.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<h3 class='c013'>I.—The Preliminary Study.</h3>

<p class='c014'>The preliminary steps should include a general examination of the
property, a study of its corporate history, an examination of its
records, maps and profiles, and the preparation of an inventory of its
property.</p>

<p class='c000'>The work in Wisconsin and Minnesota was done in co-operation
with the railroad companies, who prepared (generally, but not in every
case) their own inventories on forms adopted by the appraiser. In
Michigan, all this information was secured by the appraiser. There
can certainly be no valid objection to the use of information compiled
by the companies, whose familiarity with their own records and property
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>would enable them to supply lists which under all ordinary conditions
would be more complete and up-to-date than if made up by
men having no special knowledge of the property.</p>

<p class='c000'>The chief difficulty encountered in making an inventory from
recorded data lies in the fact that very few sets of records are corrected
to date, and many additions and erasures will of necessity have
to be made in the field.</p>

<p class='c000'>In making a field inspection, it is of great assistance to be able to
refer to maps of large yards, to profiles, to standard plans, and to
drawings of the principal structures, so that the investigation of office
records should include a careful examination of the maps of principal
terminals, with a view to securing such as will simplify the field inspection.
The investigation should be extended to cover a study, not
only of the engineering office data, but also statistical data to be derived
from the records of the auditor, superintendent, and superintendent
of motive power, and should cover earnings, operating expenses,
car and locomotive mileage, and such other data as will facilitate
the distribution of such elements of value as are not localized,
together with such other statistics as will furnish a thorough knowledge
of the property and its operations.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has been claimed by the appraiser in Washington—and the view
is also held by the Commissioner of Railroads in Nebraska—that
original cost is essential, in view of the Supreme Court's decision, particularly
in Smyth <em>vs.</em> Ames. The writer cannot accept the correctness
of this position. It would appear that the language of the Court
should be construed to mean that original cost, where ascertainable, is
a proper matter to take into account, along with many other things;
but it can hardly be considered mandatory.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the case of a property only recently built, in which the records
are complete and the engineering and construction files are available,
it may not be specially difficult to determine cost, but in the case of
any of the large railway systems of the United States, which are made
up of the consolidation of many different roads, some of them built
many years ago, some of them having gone through many changes of
management, reorganization, and earlier consolidation, it is practically
impossible to secure either the old financial books or the old construction
records, and without these complete records it would appear to be
an utter impossibility to secure the primary cost. Primary cost is but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>the first step. The work of building up, by securing the amount of
additions and betterments that have been made from year to year, is
one of appalling magnitude and of utter uncertainty and conjecture.
Keeping in mind that, prior to July 1st, 1907, the railroad companies
of the country did not have a system of uniform accounting, and that
additions to property were charged to operating expenses to the extent
of hundreds of millions of dollars; that policies were different on different
roads, and under different managements of the same road, and
that the accounting methods were determined by the policy of the road
or management; and the further fact that the distribution of ordinary
railroad accounts may be extremely reliable on one road and abounding
with errors on another; it will be seen that any attempt to depend
on the auditor's office for anything approximating a complete statement
of cost would lead into a maze of figures which would be confusing,
unreliable, and incapable of proof.</p>

<p class='c000'>Therefore, it is the writer's conclusion that, beyond such figures on
recent construction, or records of cost of such special structures as are
matters of particular record, it is not advisable to attempt to secure
complete data as to the cost to date of a railroad. In the Michigan
appraisal, original cost was secured in the case of many structures,
notably the Port Huron Tunnel, and it is by no means argued that
original cost should not be considered, or investigated, but it is held that
such an undertaking as to secure, from the financial books of the company,
an accurate or reliable statement of construction cost, plus additions
and betterments, less property destroyed, of the Michigan Central
Railroad, for example, would be absolutely an impossibility, particularly
if the work was to be undertaken, as in the Washington appraisal,
by men who were utter strangers to the property. The admission
of the appraiser of Washington, that, except for a few gaps, the
information was complete, is fatal, as the gaps must needs be filled by
estimates, and it would appear to be better to depend on estimated
figures throughout than to use what purported to be actual costs on
part and estimates on the remainder.</p>

<p class='c000'>If original cost is essential, it is hard to get away from accepting
the book values of the companies, as these, objectionable as they may
be, from the viewpoint of the public, are just as apt to be as near the
actual truth as any statement made up by strangers from an examination
of old records covering many years of operation.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>
<h3 class='c013'>II.—The Field Inspection.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The field inspection, to be of the greatest value, should be made by
civil or mechanical engineers of long experience, preferably by men
who have had charge of their respective departments on railroads of
considerable extent, or of properties similar to that under investigation.
The writer is of the opinion that in this particular phase of the
work, the practice adopted in the Michigan appraisal was considerably
in advance of more recent valuations. Each particular structure or
piece of equipment should be examined and its condition noted; special
features should be fully described and careful record made of everything
that would tend to affect the value. The argument has been
often made that the fixing of a percentage of depreciation by a man in
the field is purely arbitrary and amounts to nothing but a guess. In
the computing office it is often necessary to check the field figure of
depreciation by the use of tables of fixed annual depreciation, but it
must be borne in mind that mortality tables of any form are based on
a system of averages. The actual depreciation on rail, for instance,
varies greatly; the conditions of traffic, curvature, gradient, rolling
stock, and various local conditions tend to shorten or lengthen the life,
so that the personal opinion of an experienced man on the ground is
likely to be much more nearly correct than the arbitrary application
of a rule of averages.</p>

<p class='c000'>The writer has inspected station buildings more than 50 years old,
and their condition and adaptability for the service required of them
would give them a very high percentage; he is also familiar with
buildings less than 10 years old, which, by reason of changed traffic
conditions and consequent shifting of business, have become obsolete
and have been permitted to depreciate so rapidly that any table average
would give too high a result.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the case of a water-works inspection, so much of the value is
included in the system of distribution mains, a form of property
which is inaccessible, that much more dependence must be placed on a
figure based on age; but there, also, as full investigation as possible
should be made, in order to determine to what extent tuberculation or
electrolysis has affected the pipes.</p>

<p class='c000'>A general inspection (made in Minnesota by the appraiser with
two assistants) would appear to be an excellent thing as a review of
the whole work, but whether such an inspection would be sufficiently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>thorough to base thereon a set of final values, would appear to be
doubtful.</p>

<p class='c000'>The inspection in the field, in addition to the placing of a percentage
for depreciation, should involve a complete check of the inventory,
a correction of all errors, due to the construction of new
property or the destruction or removal of old, and a compilation of all
information required for a complete, correct, and intelligent appraisal
of the physical property by the computing office. Every appraisal is
different, and every property offers new problems and diverse conditions.
These must be met, and therefore the field inspector must call
particular attention to all matters specially affecting the values of the
property he is inspecting.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is impossible to anticipate all these conditions in advance, although
the use of carefully prepared blanks and the standardizing of
the form in which the data are gathered greatly simplify the work,
not only in the office, but in the field.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>III.  The Computation.</h3>

<p class='c014'>On the completion of the field work, with all the preliminary data
in the office, the computation must proceed, and with this part of the
work there are many questions which must be taken up, considered,
and definitely answered.</p>

<p class='c000'>The classification and arrangement of the information as to the
property to be valued, the costs and prices of the various materials
entering into construction, the making and checking of such tables as
may be required for estimating, the computing, checking, filing, indexing,
and the various other routine details of work need not be
referred to specially, as they must be worked out for each appraisal.
The matters of principle that will be met are more important, and,
while it would be impossible to mention all that may come up, it may
not be amiss to refer to a few.</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>a</em>) In making an appraisal of several properties, to what extent
shall these properties be grouped or classified?</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>b</em>) What unit prices shall be assigned in the estimates of cost of
reproduction, and how shall they be determined?</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>c</em>) How shall right-of-way and real estate values be ascertained?
Shall such elements as appreciation, or any increments due to the
purpose for which the land is used, be treated as physical or non-physical
values?</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>(<em>d</em>) What method shall be finally adopted in determining depreciation?
What elements shall depreciation be made to cover?</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>e</em>) What elements of cost or appreciation shall be treated as parts
of the physical property although not capable of inventory, and what
shall be treated as non-physical?</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>f</em>) Is an allowance for contingencies a proper item to include in
an appraisal?</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>g</em>) What weight shall be given the matters of adaptability, proper
or improper design, and the economics of location?</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>h</em>) How shall the values of such property as locomotives, cars,
etc., be geographically assigned?</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>i</em>) What is the effect upon values of large terminals?</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>j</em>) Should an allowance be made by reason of rapid development
of the art?</p>

<p class='c000'>These are not by any means all the perplexing questions that arise;
each valuation offers some that are special, but these cover the more
important points.</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>a</em>) <em>Classification of Properties.</em>—In making an appraisal involving
the properties of a large number of companies, such for instance as
any of the State railroad appraisals, it becomes evident that there are
certain properties which are small, badly run down, and either built to
serve a very limited trade or located in a territory which has not developed,
and that such properties cannot be compared equitably with
the large trunk-line roads, or even with smaller roads in a good territory
and doing a good business.  Several such properties exist in
Michigan in a district which was originally a lumber-producing
country, and at the time they were built local conditions were such
that prices of timber and labor were far below any cost that it would
be reasonable to assume to-day.  Whether taxation or rate-making be
the ultimate end of the work, it is certain that these carriers are entitled
to some classification which will separate them from the more
prosperous roads.  Many of these roads would not be built to-day under
any circumstances, yet their maintenance and continued operation is
absolutely essential to the people of the district served by them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whether this classification should be undertaken at the time of
making the appraisal of physical property, and an attempt be made
to classify unit prices, or whether this should be taken up in connection
with the intangible values, and solved, as far as the valuation is
concerned, by the adoption of such a method as will affect these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>physical values by a subtractive or negative non-physical value, or
whether the entire matter should be left for the subsequent work of
rate-making or assessment, is one which must be determined at the
outset of the physical valuation.  It may not be left without determination,
as the question will be raised in all probability in the form of an
attack on the valuation, if it is not considered and a conclusion
reached.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is the writer's opinion that the application of an intangible
subtractive value is the proper solution, except in the case of roads
which would not to-day be rebuilt.  In fixing a uniform price for identically
the same labor or material, whether on a small poverty-stricken
road or a main trunk line, no serious injustice is done, provided the
price fixed is one which, from a strictly engineering standpoint, is a
reasonable figure for cost of reproduction.  The differences in class are
due, not to special differences in cost of physical property, but rather
to differences in earning ability on account of good or poor territory
served, efficient or inefficient management, or other reasons not connected
with the physical structure; hence such differences are reflected
in the earnings, and are clearly elements to be adjusted in the non-physical
valuation.</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>b</em>) <em>Unit Values.</em>—The general reliability of the appraisal rests
very largely on the reasonableness and fairness of the various prices
which are applied to the different parts of the property in making the
estimate of cost of reproduction.  These unit prices should be determined
before any actual figures are made.  They should be made up
from the most complete data available, and, before being tabulated,
should be carefully reviewed by all the experienced men engaged on
the appraisal, in order that no figure which is either too high or too
low may be used.</p>

<p class='c000'>As a basis, the average of either 5 or 10 years should be used in
preference to current prices on all such material and equipment as is
fairly stable.  Rail, and all forms of rail structures, machinery, locomotives,
cars, etc., can be reduced to such a unit that averages can be
secured which will eliminate the error due to a period of extreme high
or low prices.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the case of such materials as lumber and ties, the price of which
has been steadily rising, due to the growing scarcity of the material,
a price based upon a long average is unfair to the corporation, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>it would appear to be proper to use current prices.  There can be
no hard-and-fast rule which will be applicable to all appraisals.  The
unit prices must be such reasonable figures as can be sustained in
Court.  Their adoption should not be final until every possible test of
their accuracy and reasonableness has been made.  When they have been
adopted, and such modification made as may be fair for certain territory,
on account of local conditions, transportation facilities, or other
consideration which may affect them, the adopted figures should
be applied to all property alike.  The use of different unit figures for
different roads in the same territory is highly undesirable, and should
be avoided.</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>c</em>) <em>Right of Way and Real Estate.</em>—The valuation work which
has been accomplished during the past decade, and the study of values
for taxation and rate-making, have brought into prominence the
perplexing features of land values as applied to corporation property.
It is comparatively simple to fix within very close limits the reproduction
cost of tracks, bridges, locomotives, or any of the other elements
of physical structure.  Not so with the land.  A few years' development
may change farm land right of way into city right of way, surrounded
by factories, or it may change desirable residential property adjacent
to a road into slums.</p>

<p class='c000'>In view of the clear language of the Court in 82 Fed., 839, and
157 Fed., 849, it is evident that any valuation which does not take
into account the appreciation or depreciation of land values cannot
be sustained.  There can be no serious objection to the doctrine that
the property of a corporation generally increases or decreases in value
in the same proportion as adjacent property, and it must therefore
be admitted that a value based on the sale value of adjacent lands
is a reasonable one and must stand.  This reasoning, of course, will
be subject to exceptions, in the case of terminal properties, docks and
water-front properties, and right of way in large cities, but it is
believed to be sound when applied to right of way in the country and
in small towns and cities.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next question to be determined is whether the increment of
value due to the use of the land is a proper one.  It would appear
that in the use of land for water-works, gas-works, street-car barns,
or other isolated tracts of land used for corporation purposes, this
increment would be much less than in the case of a steam or interurban
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>railroad, the holdings of which form a continuous and unbroken
strip; and, in the case of street railroads, water-works, and like properties,
it would be indeed difficult to compute and afterward sustain
any considerable increment.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the case of railway properties, however, it is quite evident
that the following facts can be sustained: The actual cost of property
purchased for railway purposes will range from two and one-half
to five times the selling price of similar and adjacent property used
for other purposes. While the actual percentage will vary somewhat,
as between land in cities and in the country, and as between
fully settled districts well served by roads and sparsely populated
regions, yet the difference is very marked, and is capable of determination
by an examination of the public records.</p>

<p class='c000'>This difference can be determined either by a comparison of railway
purchases and other transfers, as was done in the later studies in
Michigan and in Wisconsin, or by extending the investigation to
include assessed valuations, and using the averages, as was done in the
work of Mr. Morgan in Minnesota.</p>

<p class='c000'>In establishing figures for use in a valuation, it would appear to
be better to base them on an analysis of actual transfers than to
undertake to fix values by any methods of examination and personal
appraisal. Enough instances of the wide divergence of expert opinion
have been cited to show conclusively that such a method, applied to
the thousands of acres of a large corporation, may lead to serious
error.</p>

<p class='c000'>A single attorney or real estate man who has had experience in
abstracting and conveyancing, and who has bought some right of way,
can examine the records of an average county the largest city in
which has a population of 20,000 or less, abstract all railway transfers
for 5 years, locate them on the maps, secure data as to actual selling
prices of near-by lands, and, in a comparatively short time, be in position
to furnish figures which will establish the relation between sales
for railway and other purposes in that county. The work that half
a dozen such men could do in 90 days would go very far toward establishing
with a fair degree of definiteness the value of the railway purpose
increment for the majority of counties in any average State. Of
course, such an investigation in the large cities is a matter of much
greater labor, and would require sufficient time to make complete
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>examinations, probably necessitating a special force for such city
work.</p>

<p class='c000'>On every appraisal, the question has been asked, should this railway
purpose increment be added to the value of the property?
Clearly, yes.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Supreme Court quotes approvingly from the Tennessee Court,
as follows (151 U. S., 479):</p>

<p class='c018'>"The value of the land depends largely upon the use to which it
is put and the character of the improvements upon it."</p>

<p class='c000'>This is stated again and again. It must be remembered that, for
railroad uses, the strip must be continuous; that it must be located so
as to permit curves and grades which conform to the requirements of
the road; that, no matter what damages may accrue to adjacent property,
the road must take its strip; that its use is entirely changed
and is a structure placed on it which is capable of vastly greater
earnings than the property produced before—all these elements add to
the cost of the property when it is acquired for railway purposes, and
in the same measure to its value under its new use.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a new country, where transportation facilities are limited and
land cheap, this added increment may be little or nothing, but in a
thickly settled State, with many railroads, this element will increase
with a good degree of uniformity; while, in terminals, the price rises
to almost inconceivable figures. It is capable of being determined,
and is clearly an element in the cost of reproduction. The writer
holds to the view that it is properly to be placed with the physical values,
and that it should not be considered as an intangible element of
value.</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>d</em>) <em>Depreciation.</em>—Thus far, this discussion has not dealt at length
with the subject of depreciation, and it is not considered essential
to the purposes of this paper that it be done. The State appraisals
have raised a question as to the propriety of using mortality or life
tables as compared with personal inspection and the placing of a
percentage based on individual judgment. Either method is subject
to error. It is certainly desirable to secure the opinion of the man
who inspects a bridge, or building, or locomotive, as to its physical
condition. It may be desirable to use the check secured by the fact
that the age of the building is known and also the average life of
structures of its class.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>The result of the Michigan inspection of rolling stock was to
sustain fully the rules for valuation issued by the Master Car Builders
Association; and clearly, it is not only proper, but extremely desirable,
to apply tables to such equipment as freight cars, which are scattered
all over the United States, for it would be absolutely impossible to
inspect completely those of any road or system. On the other hand,
the life of steel rails cannot be determined by any simple table, because
the number of car movements, the weight of motive power, the speed
of trains, the location (on curves or on heavy grades), and many
other conditions affect their life. This also pertains to buildings,
locomotives, and other equipment. The character of service rendered,
the nature and extent of repairs, and the way in which they have been
maintained, add to or take away from any life assigned by tables,
so as to render them valueless in many individual instances.</p>

<p class='c000'>In placing depreciation, allowance should be made, not only for
wear and tear due to use, and decay due to the elements, but also
to cover that which is due to obsolescence, or the fact that the facility
is of an antiquated or inefficient type, and has been superseded in
general use by more efficient and economical devices; this may be
called commercial depreciation, as distinguished from physical depreciation.
The method to be used in placing depreciation is clearly
one of the important things that must be determined by each set of
appraisers, and, while the writer believes that the use of expectancy
tables would greatly facilitate the work in many cases, the data on
which to found a complete set of tables and to support them and
justify their use are often lacking; therefore, any use of tables should
be safeguarded in every possible manner, and personal inspection of
fixed property should always be made.</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>e</em>) <em>Immaterial Elements of Physical Property.</em>—There are certain
expenses, inseparable from the construction of any public works,
which are a necessary and proper part of the cost, and are arranged
for in the original financing, but are not capable of identification
after the completion of construction work. These expenses are:</p>

  <dl class='dl_2'>
    <dt>(1)</dt>
    <dd>Organization,
    </dd>
    <dt>(2)</dt>
    <dd>Legal expenses,
    </dd>
    <dt>(3)</dt>
    <dd>Engineering,
    </dd>
    <dt>(4)</dt>
    <dd>Administration,
    </dd>
    <dt>(5)</dt>
    <dd>General expense.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>(1) Organization.—This includes the cost of the original organization
of the company, the cost of securing the charter and franchises,
arranging the financial plan, and securing the funds for construction.</p>

<p class='c000'>The latter item is intended to include all salaries and expenses
of officials in soliciting and negotiating for funds, the services of
trustees, and all other proper expenses which are usual and unavoidable
in the process of exploiting a projected enterprise and interesting
capital therein. Discount on bonds is not included, and any allowances
for "premium," or "bonus," or other cash payment to any party
for services in securing funds, which are in excess of legitimate
expenses, should receive scant consideration at the hands of appraisers.</p>

<p class='c000'>(2) Legal Expense.—This is for attorneys and all legal expenses,
costs, and fees in the organization and during the construction of the
property.</p>

<p class='c000'>(3) Engineering.—This includes reconnaissance, preliminary and
location surveys, supervision of construction, and design and superintendence
of special structures. The cost of engineering on some of
the more difficult properties becomes a very large sum; on certain
small lines it may be comparatively small; and in some cases no
engineers have been employed at all; but the items of cost covered by
this charge have in every case been expended, even if done under the
direction of some superintendent.</p>

<p class='c000'>(4) Administration.—This comprises the cost of the management
during construction—the direction of the enterprise.</p>

<p class='c000'>(5) General Expense.—This is the cost of the general office organization
during the construction period, also numerous minor expenses,
not distributable.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is not possible to build any public service plant without incurring
all these expenses to a greater or less degree. They are essential
elements of cost, and must go into the value of the plant when completed.
It can hardly be argued that cost, which in a large property
runs into thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars, has no
value at the commencement of operation, nor does it appear that the
value is subject to depreciation as long as the property is an operating
plant. The writer holds the view that the line between physical and
non-physical elements of value should be drawn as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>Any value which attaches to the property by reason of any money
expended during the construction is part of the physical property
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>values; while any value due to the operation of the property which
is in excess of the physical value is a non-physical or intangible element.
If the correctness of this position be conceded, then all the
foregoing items are charges against the physical property, and, as
long as it is an operating property, these items of value remain part of
the physical property, and the writer contends that they should not be
considered as affected by depreciation, as long as the property is a
going concern.</p>

<p class='c000'>Different engineers have included in the appraisal other items
which are of a somewhat different nature, and some of which are
open to argument; among these are "interest during construction."
This item is clearly an allowable one, but serious differences of opinion
develop as to a proper amount to allow in making an appraisal.</p>

<p class='c000'>The corporate history of the Ann Arbor Railroad, in Michigan,
shows that it was built in sections of from 25 to 30 miles, and that
each section was put into operation as soon as built, so that, while
the actual period of construction of the complete property extended
over 15 years, no section was under construction much more than
one year. This is typical of much of the railroad building of the past,
and on such a property the interest charge would be comparatively
small.</p>

<p class='c000'>A proper charge in such a case would clearly not be sufficient in
the case of a road several hundred miles in length, through mountains,
with tunnels, heavy bridges, and other structures which would extend
the actual construction over periods of from 3 to 5 or 6 years, and this
is particularly true where the road is a main line or artery, and where
local traffic is of minor importance.</p>

<p class='c000'>The computation of the interest charge is complicated by the fact
that interest begins to run as the bonds are taken up, and but a
small part of the construction money draws interest during the whole
period.</p>

<p class='c000'>The practice in the State appraisals has been to fix a uniform
percentage for all properties. This has had in its favor the argument
that it was conservative valuation where taxation is the ultimate end,
as the amount was less than one year's interest in every case. It
would appear to be more correct to use the corporate history of each
company, determine the actual construction periods, and use a rate
based on the actual time in each case. This can be fixed with a fair
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>degree of accuracy, and a reasonable percentage determined, to equalize
the varying periods of time on which the interest runs on different
parts of construction.</p>

<p class='c000'>Discount.—Discount on bonds is claimed by certain railroad men
as a proper item for consideration. As has been argued elsewhere, this
is not a proper charge against capital. It is an adjustment of the
interest rate to the market, or an advance payment of interest; and, in
the writer's opinion, should under no consideration be allowed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Working Capital.—Working capital is another item claimed and
conceded in some valuations. It is not a part of the "cost of construction."
The money provided for working capital at the outset
is not a permanent investment, but is rather a temporary loan paid
back out of earnings. The writer fails to perceive any possible argument
in favor of adding such an item to the permanent value of the
property. In making an appraisal, after the physical value is determined,
it is usual to set up a statement of stores, supplies, fuel,
and cash on hand, and working capital is certainly shown by the
current balance sheet, in the form of cash or accounts receivable. It
would appear to have no place in a physical appraisal. Although the
items of cash, stores, and supplies were shown in the Michigan appraisal,
they did not appear as part of the physical value, nor were they taken
into account in computing intangible value, but, being taxable property,
they were reported separately.</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>f</em>) <em>Contingencies.</em>—The use of a percentage for contingencies
in the appraisal in Michigan was bitterly contested by the railroads
as improper and excessive. In Michigan 10% was used, in Wisconsin
5½%, and in Minnesota 5 per cent.</p>

<p class='c000'>Subsequent work in Michigan has demonstrated that the use of as
high a figure as 10% was fully justified; and the probability is that
the latest Michigan appraisal did not eliminate omissions, inaccuracies
of description, and excess cost of construction due to difficulties, to such
an extent as to justify much reduction in the percentage.</p>

<p class='c000'>In making an appraisal, the percentage to be applied to cover
contingencies is a proper matter for consideration, and in some cases
conditions might well be such that even a smaller allowance than that
fixed in Minnesota would be proper, but such cases would doubtless
be the exception. The writer believes it to be proper practice to add
liberally for the contingency item. The strongest argument against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>it is that it is incapable of being described and located definitely,
and is difficult of exact proof. Therefore it has been claimed that
it partakes of the nature of a non-physical element, and that if there
be any value over and above the physical property value, it will
appear with other non-physical elements reflected in the earnings, and
may be properly included in the intangible value if such exists. This
argument does not appeal to the writer as being final, and he would
advocate the use of such a percentage of physical values as appears
proper in each appraisal to cover the error due to the extreme difficulty
of securing an exact inventory and construction history of
the properties.</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>g</em>) <em>Design.</em>—Among the matters which were considered in the
Michigan work was that of adaptability, or the economical questions
of location, design, and construction. It is possible that in some
properties, such as water, gas or electric companies, the efficiency
of the plant may be very greatly affected by faulty design, uneconomical
arrangement, improper construction, and to such an extent that
any cost of reproduction, less any ordinary depreciation, would be
greatly in error without further allowance. This may also be true of
railroads. Excessive curvature and gradients greatly decrease the
tonnage hauled by a given power, without decreasing the cost per
train-mile.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is extremely difficult to treat this as a physical element. It is
impossible to reduce it to terms of dollars and cents by any usual
or customary methods. It is impossible to separate it from any one of
half a dozen other items that may be brought up. It opens the door
to endless speculation as to what might or might not take place under
somewhat different conditions. For these reasons, it was treated in the
Michigan appraisal as a non-physical element of value and dismissed
from all consideration in the physical appraisal. This was clearly
proper, and the subject is only referred to here for the purpose of
making clear that it was fully studied and a definite conclusion
reached.</p>

<p class='c000'>Adaptation.—In the sense that this term is used by Mr. Williams
and Mr. Morgan, the appreciation or solidification of roadbed was considered
in the Michigan work, but given no place in the appraisal.
This is a very proper item to consider, but it would appear to be better
to include it directly with the roadbed item in the physical appraisal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>as appreciation or solidification. There can be no reasonable objection
to adding to the contract prices for grading, ballasting, etc., a reasonable
amount to cover, not so much the seasoning and settling of the
new roadbed, as the actual money disbursed in work on this new roadbed
during the first 3 or 4 years of operation in order to bring it up
to the proper operating condition. A very considerable part of the
money spent on "maintenance of track" for the first few years after
a new line is built is in reality deferred construction cost.</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>h</em>) <em>Apportionment of Values.</em>—The apportionment of values of
locomotives, cars, miscellaneous equipment, shops, and those other parts
of the cost which are not susceptible of separation from the operation
of the property as a whole, is an interesting and at times a perplexing
problem. While the Courts have viewed as equitable the distribution
of values between territorial units when made on a track-mileage basis,
it is hardly likely that a Court would look with favor on an appraiser
appointed by Michigan giving any consideration to values of bridges,
track, or buildings in Ohio. Thus far, every State appraiser has concerned
himself only with the fixed physical property in his own State,
together with his proportionate share of the floating property. The
methods that may be considered are track-mileage, car-mileage, locomotive-mileage,
and train-mileage.</p>

<p class='c000'>The method finally used must be such as will give the fairest result
for the property under consideration. In some cases one or more of
these methods will give a fair value, while in other cases the same
system would be most unjust.</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>i</em>) <em>Terminals.</em>—There is no one feature of the entire problem so
big with possibilities, and so far from solution, as that of terminal
property values and their proper assignment. The property must be
considered as an operating unit. Its value must be made up of the
values of the parts or elements plus an added value that comes from
the operation of the whole. The problem would be simplified if what
were sought were the value of a certain railroad, but, as it has been
presented up to this time, the problem is: what is the value of that
part of this railroad in Michigan? or Wisconsin? or Minnesota? A
fairly satisfactory solution of many of the value questions has been
obtained, but nothing in the way of a solution of the terminal question.
A road owns 300 miles of line in Michigan and 7 miles in Ohio. That
7 miles includes its largest terminal; its principal connections are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>there; it has a fine property, and is in the capacity of landlord to several
other roads. What part of that terminal value, if any, is assignable
to the State of Michigan? Decidedly, it would not be proper to
appraise the entire property as a unit and assign to Ohio only the
proportion that 7 miles bears to the whole length; it is equally unfair
to appraise it as a Michigan property down to the State line, and add
nothing to the value by reason of the terminal.</p>

<p class='c000'>The influence on the value of the property, of the ownership of
terminals in such cities as Chicago, New York, Jersey City, Hoboken,
Pittsburg, Detroit, St. Louis, Kansas City, and other large centers of
population is tremendous, yet a very large part of the railroad mileage
entering those cities belongs to roads which have their largest mileage
outside the State in which the terminal is located.</p>

<p class='c000'>There can be no doubt that the influence of a large terminal affects
in a measure the value of every mile of line owned by the company;
that this influence is greatest on the principal and direct lines, and less
as more remote parts of the system are reached. As yet, no plan has
been suggested for determining what this value is or for apportioning
it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The final solution in Michigan was to treat terminal properties
within the State exactly as other property was treated, and to assume
that, if there was any value assignable to Michigan by reason of outside
terminals, it would appear as a non-physical value through the
earnings.</p>

<p class='c000'>When all the phases of this question are considered—the enormous
land values, the value due to possession of deep-water terminals, the
effect on the business of the entire property by reason of the ownership
of such properties as those, for instance, in New York City,
Jersey City, and Hoboken—it is evident that no appraisal which has
yet been made has established any rule of valuation which may be
considered proper for terminals.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is to be hoped that the work now in progress in New Jersey may
be so well supported by the State that it will be possible for the appraisal
board to make an exhaustive study of this subject and reach
definite conclusions as to the real extent, manner of computation, and
proper method of distribution of these values.</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>j</em>) <em>Development of the Art.</em>—Is any value assignable to property
on account of expenditures by reason of the rapid development of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>art? This question seems not to have been squarely asked or answered
in connection with any of the past appraisals.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every piece of material and every facility purchased by a company
is bought with a definite expectation that it will have a certain life,
that during that term of life it will add sufficiently to the earnings
to provide a fund for its replacement and earn a profit. No matter
whether or not such a reserve is created on the books, this is the theory,
and, under it, accident may wipe out certain new property, other property
will outlive its expectation and maintain the average life of the
entire group of facilities.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are countless cases where this will not hold. The rapid development
of large cities has compelled electric lines to extend largely.
The demands of the people for more frequent and more rapid service,
and more modern and larger equipment, have greatly shortened the
term of life of power-plant equipment and cars. The rapid development
in the art of electricity, the congestion of traffic in streets of
cities, the enormous increase of train movements, and the use elsewhere
of newer types of cars, have compelled the abandonment of millions
of dollars' worth of property and the investment of other millions in
new and improved facilities to provide for the increased movements
of traffic and increased safety to the public. These changes are not
due to the fact that the original installation was defective, but to the
demands of the public for frequent, safe, and speedy service, demands
which are perfectly reasonable. The query is: should a corporation
which complies with public demands be compelled to lose capital invested
in facilities which have not yet paid for themselves; and which,
under a continuance of conditions which existed when they were installed,
or any that might then have been anticipated, would normally
have a useful life of several more years, and which were abandoned, not
by reason of being worn out or unfit for service, but purely because
facilities of a more modern type were called for?</p>

<p class='c000'>To answer this affirmatively increases the hazard of investment
greatly in the large centers of population. To answer it affirmatively
in some cases might amount to confiscation of property. The writer
inclines to the view that, as far as appraisal is concerned, the value
due to the remaining life of the abandoned facility, where such abandonment
was in response to legal requirement, and where no element
of corporate necessity due to increased efficiency or economy of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>new facility enters into the computation, should be added to the value
of the facility replacing it. Any consideration that is given such
claims by an appraiser must be most careful, as the inference to be
drawn from the decision of the Court in the Knoxville Water Case
(212 U. S., 1) is that such elements of value will receive scant consideration
unless most fully supported.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the policy of the management of any public service company is
to keep up with the demands of modern civilization, it would appear
that such policy should not be discouraged, and, in computing the
value of the property, some provision ought to be devised for covering
such values as remain in serviceable property at the time of its
abandonment in response to public demand; or else the rates for service
should be increased sufficiently to compensate the corporation for
losses of this nature on the ground that it constitutes an element of
extra hazard.</p>

<p class='c000'>These and like subjects in connection with the appraisal must be
taken up during the period of computation and settled. The computing
office organization and methods call for no special comment,
except to emphasize the need of experienced men, the use of every
possible check on the accuracy of the work, and the prime necessity
of keeping all notes in such manner that they can be identified and
used to re-establish every step taken in the course of the appraisal.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>IV.—The Preparation of the Final Figure.</h3>

<p class='c014'>The final form of the work is, of course, so much a matter of personal
judgment that even a suggestion may appear to be useless. The
use of such a classification as will conform approximately, if not exactly,
with that adopted by the Interstate Commerce Commission
is more desirable now than it was 10 years ago, as all the roads in
the country are using this classification in their accounts, and the
more nearly uniform the work of various State appraisals, the better
the results will be.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r18'>18</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Unchangeable only for the period under consideration and as regards the purpose of

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>Non-Physical Values and Methods for Their Determination.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In the published articles treating on the subject of valuation, much
stress is laid on the intangible or non-physical elements of value.
They have been termed "going concern values," "business values,"
"good will values," "franchise values," as well as "non-physical" and
"intangible" values.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>So much of the argument of many writers has been taken up with
this phase of the question that it is impracticable to recapitulate the
various arguments in support of giving these elements a place in the
appraisal.</p>

<p class='c000'>The writer cannot agree with those who would place any of these
elements of value in the physical appraisal.</p>

<p class='c000'>Value is given to a property, either by reason of the fact that it is
an instrument for earning profit, or that it does earn profit or gives
promise of profit. The actual investment of capital in a new plant
is made with the expectation of earnings. It is not reasonable to
attach as physical value, to such a plant, any value in excess of the
actual investment. Nor does it appear to be any more reasonable, in
the case of an old plant, to assign arbitrary and fictitious values over
and above the actual investment remaining in the plant, unless such
values are justified and supported by actual earnings in excess of such
a rate of interest on the money invested, as it would earn if invested
in some non-hazardous security, and—carrying out the clearly-expressed
idea of the Courts—such intangible value can only accrue when
the rates charged for the service are fair and proper.</p>

<p class='c000'>The capitalist seeking investment bases his ideas of value on:</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>a</em>) The market price of stocks and bonds, an estimate of worth
based primarily on actual earnings of the property, but
affected to some extent by outside conditions; or</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>b</em>) On the capitalized net income, or actual earnings, of the
property; or,</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>c</em>) In the case of a new property, on an estimate of what the
probable earning capacity of the property will be, where the
business is more fully developed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Methods (<em>a</em>) and (<em>b</em>) ignore cost of construction, or present investment
in physical property, and base a value on past performances.
Method (<em>c</em>) is based purely on hypothetical earnings, but the only
real measure of value in this instance is the actual amount of capital
that has been invested.</p>

<p class='c000'>No appraiser would be justified in placing a "going concern" value,
in excess of original cost, on a new property, nor would he be justified
in placing such a value on a property 3 years old, or 10 years old,
unless the net earnings were such as to indicate that the property had
a business or commercial value in excess of the physical property value.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>It would seem reasonable to say that this difference between the
physical value and the value based on earnings represents the "good
will," "established business," or "going value," and all the other non-physical
elements of value.</p>

<p class='c000'>To take a specific example: it would be impossible to separate the
different elements of intangible value of the Michigan Central Railroad,
and say that a certain sum of money represented "good will,"
another sum "established business," still another sum the "franchise
value," and still another sum the "going concern."</p>

<p class='c000'>The "going concern value" of the Michigan Central Railroad is
exactly analogous to the going concern value of the hypothetical
water-works cited by Mr. Alvord. Instead of having water pipes connected
with buildings along the mains, and considerable sums invested
in appliances for using the water, there are manufacturing plants
located along the railroad, connected with it by side-tracks built by
the industry, and depending on the transportation facilities of the road
for their connections with their customers, the very life of the manufacturing
plant dependent on its connection with the road. This is
"connected good will" of the same kind as described by Mr. Alvord.
Yet, to fix a value on it by the method described by him involves going
into the realm of conjecture and speculation to a degree that could
never be sustained.</p>

<p class='c000'>Difficulties as great would be encountered in an effort to separate
and set up any other elements which go to make up the intangible
value, and any figure thus determined would be absolutely incapable
of proof.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Courts say that the value must be the "fair value of the
property being used," all the conditions being taken into account
(169 U. S., 466).</p>

<p class='c000'>It can be readily seen that the physical present value is not always—indeed,
is not often—the "fair value." The "fair value" may be
more, or less, than the present value of the physical property. It
would seem to be reasonable to interpret the Court's meaning of the
term "fair value" to be the value as a business or commercial property,
taking into account the actual investment existing in the property,
together with any favorable conditions which would enable it to earn,
on rates which were fair and reasonable to the consumer, an income in
excess of a usual rate of interest on the actual investment, or any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>unfavorable ones which under the same rates would reduce its earnings
to less than usual interest. If such an interpretation be allowable, it
would appear to be correct practice to use a "fair value" made up of
two elements: a physical value, representing the investment, and a
non-physical value, representing all the elements which affect that
investment to give it favorable or unfavorable financial returns. Is
it not, then, proper to conclude that the non-physical or intangible
value, composed of all these various elements of value, can only be
determined absolutely by a study of the earnings and operating
expenses? Is not this clearly what the Court had in mind in the
Nebraska Rate Case?</p>

<p class='c000'>Much of the argument on the subject of "going" values and other
kindred elements of value consists of statements of theory and generalities,
and may be said to be merely argument to support the theory
that there is an intangible element of value. If work of valuation is
to be of any real benefit, must it not give a definite result? Must not
this result be based on absolute facts?</p>

<p class='c000'>In securing the present value of any physical property the fixed
and certain facts are:</p>

<p class='c005'>The inventory of property owned.—This is absolute.</p>

<p class='c005'>The cost of reproduction of the different elements.—This is capable
of determination within very close limits.</p>

<p class='c005'>The depreciation.—This is in a measure a matter of judgment,
based on the experience, not only of the engineers making the
appraisal, but of the entire scientific world; and, if properly
made and properly checked, there should be no very wide
divergencies in results.</p>

<p class='c005'>The items of general expense.—These, based on available statistics,
must be estimated. The exact determination of these items
will be made comparatively easy as statistics based on the
uniform classification of accounts become available.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is believed that the physical values, when secured along the lines
suggested, are definite enough to be accepted as a fair estimate of the
amount of capital actually invested in the property, and that, if a
sufficiently large force of men experienced in the construction, operation,
and financial management of the kind of property under investigation
is engaged on the work, the element of uncertainty due to
errors of personal judgment can be largely eliminated.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>The next question to be determined is whether there is, at the time
of the appraisal, any non-physical value, and, if so, to select a method
for computing it that will give a result that can be definitely supported
as to the particular property under investigation. A study of the
income accounts of the property being valued should be made. If the
property is not earning a sufficient sum to pay its operating expenses,
and taxes, and to set aside a fund to cover depreciation and obsolescence,
there is clearly no intangible value of any sort to be added
to the physical value. If, however, after all these charges are taken
care of, there is a net earning which is large enough to pay 4 or 5%
on the physical property and still leave a surplus, is it not perfectly
reasonable and proper to hold that this surplus represents earnings
on all intangible elements of value?</p>

<p class='c000'>The contention that all the different elements of non-physical
value merge into one intangible value, not capable of separation, will
doubtless be objected to by many engineers and corporation managers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the elements adding value to property have been described:</p>

<p class='c000'><em>1.—"Going Concern" Value.</em>—Professor Mead defines this as the
value due to the fact that a plant has consumers actually utilizing
its product, and that it is in actual and successful operation and has
its business developed. This value is the worth of the plant in excess
of a similar plant without connections, and constitutes an asset in the
consideration of its physical value. Mr. Alvord has used the term
"connected good will" as applicable to this element of value.</p>

<p class='c000'>The writer does not concede that "going concern" is a proper element
to consider in the physical value, as it does not represent any
part of the cost chargeable to capital, and the physical valuation should
be confined to the determination of capital invested.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has already been argued that to the physical property as inventoried
should be added proper figures to cover organization, legal
expense, administration, engineering, and contingencies. All these
items are in the nature of additions on account of the fact that the
property is a "going concern." It is maintained that these costs
should carry to the present value column as values, for the reason
that all these services rendered in connection with the creation of the
property remain, unimpaired in value, as long as the property is operated.
When, however, a property ceases to be operated, and is abandoned
and dismantled, not only do all these elements absolutely disappear,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>but also all increments of value by reason of the special use
of the property are wiped out, and there exist only a lot of partly
worn out and partly obsolete machinery and equipment, salable at
scrap values, buildings constructed for a purpose which renders them
unfit for other use, and land partly salable at going prices and much
that will not sell at all.</p>

<p class='c000'>As long as a gas-works, a water-works, or a railroad is in operation
and earning, it is a "going concern," and all increments which attach
to its physical property as a whole continue to exist, even if the
physical value of the property is greater than a fair value. That
fair value can be determined and reached by means of a negative non-physical
value.</p>

<p class='c000'>In view of these things, it would seem to be highly improper to
add to physical value anything more for "going concern." In the
final report of U. S. Judge R. W. Tayler, Arbitrator in the Cleveland
Street Railway matter, in December, 1909, the following language
supports the above contention:</p>

<p class='c018'>"I allow nothing for going value, except in so far as that is the
result of the necessary expenditure of money in building the road,
acquiring its land, power-houses, and equipment, and putting them into
successful operation. The expenditures for these purposes are, and
necessarily must be, included in the valuation of the physical property."</p>

<p class='c000'><em>2.—Developed Business.</em>—It is perfectly clear that the "fair value"
of a property must take into account the established business of the
concern. This really is covered by the "going concern values," as
defined by Messrs. Mead and Alvord. The only manner in which this
can be determined intelligently is by an analysis of income accounts.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>3.—Cost of Handling Business.</em>—A railroad with heavy grades,
bad curves, poor equipment, or unskilful management is not nearly as
valuable a property as one having good line and grades, and far-sighted,
economical, and skilful management, and which handles its
business at a lower cost per unit.</p>

<p class='c000'>In such cases the differences in location and management are bound
to show in the earnings, adding to the physical value of one property
and possibly taking from the value as shown by the physical appraisal
in the case of another.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>4.—Good Will and Established Organization.</em>—These are valuable
assets. It is difficult, indeed, to attach exact weight to these elements
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>of value, except as they are shown in the intangible value indicated by
the earnings. In most cases of public service companies, as is argued
elsewhere, it is doubtful if such elements are entitled to any place in a
public valuation.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>5.—Franchise Values.</em>—These cover various specific items arising
out of the ownership of special franchises, or, out of the general rights
granted by law to corporations.</p>

<p class='c000'>All these elements of value have been presented, and have been supported
by able arguments. No one has offered a method of separating
them. While there is universal recognition of their existence, in the
case of many properties, they are supported by nothing visible or
tangible. They are practically inseparable, one from another. They
are not always present, and the application of any such arbitrary rule
as that suggested by Mr. Alvord would make it possible to place values
which were purely fictitious. Therefore, it follows that, if they are to
be considered at all, they must be treated as parts of one intangible
value, and that value must be derived from a study of the income account
of the property.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are other points to be noted as reasons why no such elements
of value may attach to the physical property.</p>

<p class='c000'>Any value of an old and well-established property in excess of a
fair return on its physical property (in other words, any intangible
value) must be limited and restricted, when used for rate-making purposes,
by the value to the consumer of the services rendered. The
Courts hold so squarely that the rates charged for services must not
be more than the particular service is worth, and that the Company
may exact a fair return on property actually being used, that it is not
conceivable that any valuation which attempts to attach fictitious
elements of value to physical property can be sustained.</p>

<p class='c000'>This argument is not intended as an attempt to show that intangible
values are improper and that where they exist rates should be lowered.
It is contended that the determination of rates that will be just and
fair to all competing companies involves other consideration than the
valuation of either physical or intangible properties, and that when all
these rate-making problems are properly solved, there will remain large
intangible values on the well-designed plants. It is further contended
that the work of valuation should separate the tangible and intangible
elements, so that the further work of rate-making or assessment may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>not be complicated by improper elements which are included among the
items of the physical properties.</p>

<p class='c000'>In consideration of franchise value, the history of the corporation
should be investigated with a view to determine what part the public
played in the creation of the property.</p>

<p class='c000'>The granting of aid bonds, of public lands, and of aid money to
railroads, the giving of encouragement to water-works companies by the
payment of excessive hydrant rentals, are illustrations of the fostering
and development of public service utilities by the public to such an
extent as to justify in a large measure the claim that in many cases
the allowance of an intangible value is improper as against the public.</p>

<p class='c000'>A further consideration in the matter of intangible values is the
fact that they all partake more or less of the nature of "good will,"
and the question very properly arises, in the case of a purchase by the
public, or of a rate-making valuation:  "Should the public be compelled
to pay for its own good will?" In the case of such a corporation as a
street-railway company in a large city, any value arising from a surplus
of earnings is due to the franchise, established business, or going
value, or good will of the citizens of that city.   This element of value
frequently sustains an excessive bond indebtedness.   At the expiration
of the franchise period the citizens of that city consider a purchase,
and are asked to pay, among other things, for their own good will.   In
view of the attitude of the Federal Courts in the Consolidated Gas Case,
and the language of the lower Court in disallowing the item of "good
will," which judgment was sustained by the Supreme Court, it is very
evident that any attempt to fix arbitrarily a value on such an item in
an appraisal is not likely to be supported successfully. The grounds
named by the Court are:</p>

<p class='c005'>Tangible property has a value apart from any franchise or good
will value.</p>

<p class='c005'>The franchise, conferring the privilege to be a corporation, to use
public property, to be free from competition, and to enjoy
many other privileges, has some value apart from tangible
property.</p>

<p class='c005'>Good will can have no existence as apart from or detached from
the franchise conferring the necessary privilege. Such good
will (by itself) is not capable of being capitalized and distributed
among stockholders.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>Citizens are entitled to have gas (or water) because they pay for
it, exactly as they are entitled to have clean streets (and, in
the same way, police protection or fire protection), because
they pay taxes among other things for that.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Court, therefore, finds that there is no good will value in connection
with the gas business in the City of New York, although it is
said, elsewhere in the finding, that it is the best, most favorably located,
and most prosperous business of its kind in the country.</p>

<p class='c000'>Judge Tayler, in the Cleveland Railway arbitration, says:</p>

<p class='c018'>"I allow nothing for good will.  A street railway company which
has a monopoly, and especially if it has a franchise value remaining,
can have no good will value."</p>

<p class='c000'>Judge Lurton, in the Omaha Water-Works Case, says:</p>

<p class='c018'>"That kind of good will, as suggested in Willcox <em>vs.</em> Consolidated
Gas Co., is of little or no commercial value when the business is, as
here, a natural monopoly with which he must deal, whether he will
or no."</p>

<p class='c000'>In connection with a consideration of franchise values, the following
points are raised by the Federal Court in the Consolidated Gas
Cases (157 Fed., 872-879):</p>

<p class='c018'>"Should a corporation have a right to demand an income return,
separable from any return upon its tangible property, from its right
to place gas mains in the public streets and maintain them for its
private profit, a right which it did not buy from city or state or pay
therefor any legal valuable consideration?  The Court thinks not, because
'Return can be expected only from investment, and he that
invests must part with something in the act of investing.'  Does any
company invest its franchise in its business?  It does not part with its
franchise in the same way it parted with money or money's worth in
acquiring or creating mains or plants. The investment of property was
made, not in the franchise, but under the franchise, and on the faith
thereof. The franchise is but a part of the power or sovereignty,
allotted to a private person for the benefit of all, and only incidentally
given for private emoluments.</p>

<p class='c018'>"What is the value of a franchise to perform a certain service, under
which no money is invested and no service yet performed?  What is it
worth apart from performance under it?</p>

<p class='c018'>"Unless it can be seen to possess inherent value entirely apart from
the earning capacity of the subsequent investment or from the actual
earnings resulting from such investment, the value asserted or claimed
is but a duplication of that derived from the use of the tangible property
when so invested.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>"The concepts of the nature and value of franchises are seen dimly
and confusedly because of the failure to distinguish between productive
and non-productive property. Land, money, chattels may by
industry and intelligence be made productive without a franchise; but
no excellence in these desirable qualities can ultimately render a franchise
productive without the use of money, chattels, and land in connection
therewith, and when the juncture is made the earning capacity
of the real and personal property, plus the franchise and plus intelligence
and industry, is really no greater than it would be without the
franchise, for the franchise has added no producing power to the realty
or personalty; it has but authorized their employment in a particular
way and protected the owners while so employing them."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Court emphasized the fact that the particular way in which
they are used is in performing a function of the State—in doing
a service for the public which the public might do equally well for
itself, in the following language:</p>

<p class='c018'>"I can imagine no more than three ways in which the value of a
franchise can be stated. It is valuable: (1) because it authorizes the
gainful use of private property in a particular manner; (2) because
once obtained it is often difficult or impossible to get another like it;
(3) because it may be used to injure or hinder another enterprise,
although itself conferring or securing nothing of value.</p>

<p class='c018'>"The third method of statement has been accurately, though colloquially,
described as a 'nuisance value,' and is so obviously illegitimate
as to require no discussion. The second method of statement, when
carefully considered, asserts that because the sovereign has deemed it
advisable to entrust a public work to one citizen or a body of citizens
such quasi monopolistic grant confers the right to charge for the service
more than would be just or lawful were the occupation open to all.
Nor does it change the truth of the last statement that the difficulty
of procuring franchises produces, and long has produced, a traffic in
them. On every private sale of franchise property, the price paid is so
much money lost to the public by official incompetence or worse, and
such sale can confer on the vendee no right to compel the consumer to
repay him a price that should have been paid to the State. For these
reasons, I believe that on principle a franchise should be held to have
no value except that arising from its use as a shield to protect those
investing their property on the faith thereof, and that, it renders fruitful,
it possesses no more economic value for the investor than does an
actual shield possess fighting value, apart from the soldier who bears it."</p>

<p class='c000'>It will not do to leave this decision without calling attention to the
fact that the foregoing quotations are but argument advanced by the
Court, and that he found a franchise value, following the reasoning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>of the Supreme Court in cases cited heretofore, and other cases, and
upon the doctrine that:</p>

<p class='c018'>"Private citizens may acquire vested property rights through a series
of even erroneous decisions; rights so firmly vested that it becomes
unconstitutional for the court which persisted in error suddenly to
rectify its mistakes to the detriment of those who had securely rested
upon the decisions sought to be invalidated."</p>

<p class='c000'>After citing numerous cases, and considering methods of valuing
franchises, the Court says:</p>

<p class='c018'>"I think it obvious, as I have endeavored heretofore to point out,
that either for the purpose of condemnation or regulation the value
of a franchise depends wholly upon what is earned under it and I believe
the best way of finding out how much a franchise, separately considered,
is worth, is to ascertain what those persons desirous of continuing
operation under it consider it to be worth. In a corporation
whose stock is freely bought and sold, such value is measured by the
success attending the sale of stock based entirely upon capitalization
of the franchise; yet the value of stock issued only in consideration of
the franchise is obviously dependent on earnings after the stock based
on tangible property has received a satisfactory dividend * * * yet
it will always be true that, unless the whole net return, compared with
the value of tangibles, is above a satisfactory return on tangible investment
alone, the addition of stock issued for franchise will be regarded
as 'water,' and detract from the value of the entire issue, and
I think this conclusive proof that value on a franchise depends wholly
on what actual investment can earn."</p>

<p class='c000'>In this particular instance stock to the amount of $7,781,000 had
been issued in 1884 and divided among stockholders without any consideration,
which stock represented the company's own valuation of its
franchise at that date. The Court, in fixing a value, held that it
would be proper to increase it proportionately to the increase in tangible
property; this he did, fixing the franchise value at more than
$12,000,000. The Supreme Court of the United States, in disposing of
this, says (212 U. S., 47):</p>

<p class='c018'>"But although the state ought for these reasons [applicable to this
case—not general], to be bound to recognize the value agreed upon in
1884 as part of the property upon which a reasonable return can be
demanded, we do not think an increase in that valuation ought to be
allowed upon the theory suggested by the Court below. Because the
amount of gas supplied has increased to the extent stated, and the other
and tangible property of the corporations has increased so largely in
value, is not, as it seems to us, any reason for attributing a like proportional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>increase in the value of the franchises. Real estate may have
increased in value very largely, as also the personal property, without
any necessary increase in the value of the franchises. Its past value
was founded upon the opportunity of obtaining these enormous and
excessive returns upon the property of the company, without legislative
interference with the price for the supply of gas, but that immunity
for the future was, of course, uncertain, and the moment it ceased and
the legislature reduced the earnings to a reasonable sum, the great
value of the franchises would be at once and unfavorably affected, but
how much so it is not possible for us to see. The value would most
certainly not increase."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Court did not concur in the increase of the franchise value, and,
in dismissing this subject, says:</p>

<p class='c018'>"What has been said herein regarding the value of the franchises
in this case has been necessarily founded upon its own peculiar facts,
and the decision can form no precedent in regard to the valuation of
franchises generally where the facts are not similar to those in the case
before us."</p>

<p class='c000'>It appears, then, from this, the latest case, that:</p>

<p class='c000'><em>1.</em>—The view of the lower Court that a franchise or intangible value
is not separable, and that if there be a value it must be determined
from the earnings, is concurred in by the Supreme Court.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>2.</em>—That the arbitrary increase of franchise value, by the lower
Court, proportional to the normal increase of the physical property, is
not concurred in.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>3.</em>—Inferentially, it appears that the acquiescence of the State in
the franchise value of 1884 is the main reason for permitting that value
to stand, and it would seem to follow, from the reasoning of the Court,
that it is very questionable whether any franchise or intangible value
based on excessive rates should be allowed to stand.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another view of franchise values, as stated by George H. Benzenberg,
Past-President, Am. Soc. C. E., in discussing water-works franchises,
is as follows:</p>

<p class='c018'>"Some contend that a franchise is simply and purely a privilege
given by the municipality to a water company to utilize the streets
for the purpose of laying a system of pipes through which it may distribute
and deliver water. It is not a license to do business, but a
privilege to use public streets, alleys, and grounds. * * * If that
interpretation is the proper one, the value of the franchise, if the
property is to be purchased by a municipality, is comparatively nothing.
If the property is to be purchased by another company, it represents
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>all of the great value that such franchise possesses to the original
holder, together with all the privilege it confers; but in the event it is
purchased by the city, it is dispossessed of that certain element of value,
and I think for that reason it is stipulated in many of the ordinances
that no value shall be placed on the franchise by appraisers."</p>

<p class='c000'>In the paragraph just quoted, it is evident that the term "franchise"
is used in a restricted sense, and refers to the ordinance or contract
from a municipal corporation granting the right to operate on specific
terms, rather than the broad use of the word as indicating all rights
derived from general laws or special contracts or grants. The point,
however, is applicable to the case of any corporation occupying public
ground.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is believed that enough argument has been adduced to show that
any attempt to give separate value to the different elements that enter
into the intangible value of a property is a very risky proceeding on
the part of appraisers, and to support further the contention that, as a
business proposition, the value of any property depends on its earnings;
that the franchise simply protects the owners of the property in their
enjoyment of those earnings; that the value of the franchise merges
in the "fair value" of the property, and that the franchise can have no
special value of itself unless the earnings of the property are in excess
of a usual and fair rate on the actual investment. In case there are
surplus earnings, they measure and determine not only the value of the
franchise, but also the value of all other non-physical elements. If this
be true, any readjustment of rates, any restriction of operations, or
other form of legislative control which would unfavorably and violently
affect earnings, is bound to hold down franchise or non-physical
values; as it would not seem possible to read into the various decisions
any intention on the part of the Court to base the right to demand fair
return on anything but the "fair value of the property being used."</p>

<p class='c000'>The writer, therefore, reaches the following conclusions regarding
non-physical  values:</p>

<p class='c000'><em>1.</em>—That all the different non-physical  elements of value are inseparable.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>2.</em>—That in the case of very many properties, no non-physical value
can attach, and in many cases this value will be a negative or subtractive
quantity.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>3.</em>—That in the case of properties located so as to secure either a
monopoly of business in a congested territory, or in which the construction,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>location, strategic position, or economic excellence of design, is
such that, on a schedule of rates which is fair and reasonable for competitors
less advantageously situated, an earning is secured which is
in excess of usual returns, a non-physical value of considerable magnitude
may very properly be assigned.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>4.</em>—That, for the computation of non-physical values, the income
account of the property under consideration affords the only legitimate
basis, but even then consideration must be given to duration of franchise,
reasonableness of rates, and other modifying conditions, and
also, possibly, the purpose for which the appraisal is made may determine
whether or not a non-physical value may be used. The language
of the Court in the Knoxville and Omaha cases apparently leaves this
a very open question.</p>

<p class='c000'>This brings us substantially to the conclusion reached by Professor
Adams in 1900, and a careful study of the method laid down by him
shows nothing that cannot be accepted as fair and reasonable. His
plan should be extended so as to cover subtractive values or the case
of properties showing a deficit.</p>

<p class='c000'>This method has the merit of being based on the actual earnings
and expenses of the company under investigation and on the value of
the physical property as already computed. It does not introduce a
mass of purely supposititious figures, nor depend on hypothesis. The
proposition is simply this: If a property earns only its operating expenses,
including therein proper depreciation reserves, taxes, and such
a percentage on its actual invested capital as could be earned by that
capital if invested in good non-taxable bonds or other like security,
it is worth no more than its physical property is worth. If it earns
more than that, it is due to the franchise, going concern, or other intangible
elements of value, and, to determine that value, capitalize the
surplus.</p>

<p class='c000'>It takes several years for a property to reach its normal earning
capacity after construction is completed, and, in the investigation of a
property of comparatively recent construction, where the gross and net
earnings show a steady annual increase, the application of a negative or
subtractive value should be made with great caution; but where the
earnings have been fairly uniform and stationary for a period of years,
and the property does not earn a sufficient sum to care for depreciation
and annuity, it is clear that the value as an earning investment is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>less than the determined physical value, and that the physical valuation
should be reduced by some amount to arrive at the "fair value."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Courts hold that public service corporations are entitled to
earn:</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>a</em>) Operating expenses,</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>b</em>) Expenses of maintenance and running repair,</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>c</em>) Taxes,</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>d</em>) A sinking fund from earnings to cover depreciation and
obsolescence, and</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>e</em>) A reasonable profit on the fair value of the property.</p>

<p class='c000'>An investigation of non-physical values should then include an
analysis of operating expenses, to determine that additions and betterments
to property are not included therein.</p>

<p class='c000'>The general practice of corporations in the past has been to ignore
any reserve to cover depreciation and obsolescence. If, at the beginning
of operations of any property, such a sum should be annually set
aside out of earnings as should, when invested as a sinking fund, maintain
the integrity of the investment, then this amortization fund at
any period, plus the depreciated value of the physical property, should
equal the amount of the total capital actually invested in the property.
In most cases this has not been done, and the Supreme Court in the
Knoxville Water Case holds that, by reason of the failure to create such
a fund, whether due to carelessness, excessive dividends, or other cause,
the company must lose the amount of capital represented by the depreciation
that has taken place. In making a computation of intangible
values, it is certainly proper to consider the income account as
averaged over a period of years, to avoid violent fluctuations of gross
or net earnings, and a depreciation reserve should be determined for
such years, as it cannot be claimed that, unless such an amortization
fund is earned, in addition to other operating expenses and taxes, there
is any non-physical value.</p>

<p class='c000'>Professor Adams covered the depreciation in the Michigan work in
the 4% annuity which was deducted before non-physical values were
computed. The writer is inclined to go a step farther than Professor
Adams, and hold that, before any intangible values can be attached to
the property, it should earn not only all operating expenses, taxes, and
reserve for depreciation, but also interest on the actual investment
equivalent to the return that would be had were the money invested
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>in a non-taxable bond, say 4%, and that any earnings in excess of such
a sum might be termed properly "earnings on franchise," or intangible
values.</p>

<p class='c000'>On this basis, then, a rule would be formulated, being that of Professor
Adams, with some modifications:</p>

<p class='c000'><em>1.</em>—Deduct from gross earnings from operation the aggregate of
operating expenses, including in operating expenses an annual sinking
fund to amortize the depreciation and obsolescence, and the remainder
may be termed "income from operation."</p>

<p class='c000'><em>2.</em>—To this income from operation add income from investment,
giving "total income," which represents the amount at the disposal of
the corporation for the support of its capital and for the determination
of its annual surplus.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>3.</em>—From "total income," deduct taxes, rents paid for lease of operated
property (provided such property is not included in the appraisal),
and improvements chargeable to income. The remainder represents
the income after all charges against operation of property, and maintenance
of the integrity of the capital investment have been cared for.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>4.</em>—From this remainder (<em>3</em>) deduct such a percentage of the value
of the physical property (representing invested capital) as would equal
the income of that capital if invested in government or other non-taxable
bonds. The remainder would represent surplus, which, capitalized
at a proper rate, would equal the value of intangible or non-physical
properties, which is to be added to the appraised value of the "physical
property."</p>

<p class='c000'><em>5.</em>—If, instead of a surplus, a deficit occurs, a careful study of all
the conditions surrounding the operations of the property should be
made, and, if there be no reasonable expectation of increase of earnings,
or other modifying conditions, a proper figure, based on the average deficit,
should be determined, and, as a negative intangible value, deducted
from the value of the physical property.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>6.</em>—In the determination of rates, to be used in computing income
and for capitalizing surplus or deficit, the greatest of care must be
exercised to adopt such figures as will be proper and absolutely just.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>Conclusion.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The subject of valuation is so appallingly great that, notwithstanding
the length this paper has reached, many points have not been
covered.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>No discussion of the method of valuation by capitalization of net
earnings, which is practically that adopted by Professor Adams in his
commercial valuation, has been attempted; nor has any attempt been
made to describe the stock and bond method. Neither method is
adaptable to the requirements of any public appraisal.</p>

<p class='c000'>The so-called cash investment in property, or the actual cost of
construction through the entire history of the property, cannot be sustained
by any process of argument as a proper method of valuation,
nor can the method of computing the cost of construction of an adequate
modern property assumed to replace the existing property. The
scope of a valuation must be limited to the property as it exists on the
date of the appraisal, and it would be equally fallacious to include non-existent
and long-perished facilities, or to assume a hypothetical and
never-existing property.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are many intricate problems in connection with a valuation
for rate-making or taxation which really belong to these undertakings,
not to valuation. They are usually brought into the discussion of valuation,
but have been here excluded. Among these are the separation of
interstate from intra-state business, and others, of great interest, it
is true, but foreign to the subject of valuation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The question of the fair return on money invested is not referred
to, for the reason that it has no direct bearing on valuation, and for
the further reason that it has been quite exhaustively discussed in the
papers listed in the Appendix. The writer desires to make clear the
fact that he is not advocating low rates <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i>. The rate must be
determined to meet the special requirements of each investigation. The
Supreme Court of Maine says (97 Maine):</p>

<p class='c018'>"The reasonableness of the rate may for a time be affected by the
degree of hazard to which the original enterprise was naturally subjected.
That is such hazard only as may have been justly contemplated
by those who made the original investment, and not unforeseen and
emergent risks, and such allowances may be made as is demanded by
ample and fair public policy."</p>

<p class='c000'>While the Supreme Court of the United States, in Willcox <em>vs.</em> Consolidated
Gas (212 U. S., 12), fixed a rate of 5½% as reasonable in that
instance, they said:</p>

<p class='c018'>"No particular rate of compensation must in all cases be regarded
as sufficient for capital invested in business enterprises. Such compensation
must depend greatly on circumstances and locality. Among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>other things the amount of risk in the business is an important factor,
as well as the locality where the business is conducted and the rate
expected and usually realized there upon investments of a somewhat
similar nature with regard to the risk attending them. There may be
other matters which in some cases might also be properly taken into
account in determining the rate which an investor might properly expect
or hope to receive and which he would be entitled to without legislative
interference. The less risk, the less right to any unusual return
upon the investments."</p>

<p class='c000'>In view of these dicta, it is needless to argue whether a rate of 6%
or 10%, or 15%, or more, be reasonable.</p>

<p class='c000'>The writer has herein endeavored to narrate the story of the Michigan
appraisal in some detail, to review briefly subsequent similar work,
to present the main points in the legal decisions bearing on appraisal
practice, and to present his own views as to proper and legitimate
methods of valuation in the light of judicial opinions. He has attempted
to do this in the spirit of absolute fairness, without permitting either
early years of training in corporation service, or more recent investigations
for State and city, to bias the presentation of truths.</p>

<p class='c000'>The subject is one which has not attracted the average citizen sufficiently
to compel him to give it deep study. Those who are familiar
with it all too frequently have views biased by interest, and it is hardly
conceivable that any final conclusion will be reached until each and all
of the main issues are determined by the Courts. When thus determined,
it will be done with wisdom and with justice. It is impossible
to study the cases referred to without being impressed with the absolute
fairness of this great tribunal. Quotations from decisions have been
included at considerable length in order to obviate the criticism that
the references do not convey the exact meaning of the Courts.</p>

<p class='c000'>The writer acknowledges the valuable suggestions, criticisms, and
information furnished him by Professors Henry C. Adams, Mortimer
E. Cooley and W. D. Pence; Mr. Henry L. Gray, Engineer of the Railroad
Commission, Washington; Mr. D. F. Jurgensen, Engineer, Railroad
and Warehouse Commission, Minnesota; Mr. Bion J. Arnold, and
others who have made possible the presentation of data regarding State
and other appraisals.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>DISCUSSION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Fred Lavis</span>, <span class='sc'>M. Am. Soc. C. E.</span>—The author states that his paper
is confined to "a discussion of the methods which should be used in
arriving at a correct figure of cost of reproduction and depreciation,"
and that "it does not take up questions involving the propriety of those
figures when reached." In so far as this is concerned, it is probably
the most complete compilation of the available information on this
phase of the subject which has yet appeared in print. The author
refuses to recognize that the consideration of the so-called intangible
values has any place in a physical valuation. As, however, there
exists such a widespread feeling, especially among those interested in
railroads, that physical valuations, for any purpose whatever, are
absolutely useless, because these intangible values are not or cannot
be included, it does not seem out of place to refer to this phase of
the subject at this time, and more especially in view of the fact that
many persons, the prominence of whose position entitles them to consideration,
have taken this point of view very recently, and their
remarks have received considerable publicity. Not more than two
weeks ago, Judge Lovett, the head of the Harriman System, expressed
the opinion that the theory of valuing railroad property by trying to
determine the cost of reproduction was utterly impractical. It seems
important, therefore, that we, as engineers, interested in having the
question properly understood, should be careful, in referring to valuation,
to make it plain that other features besides the value of the
physical property are to receive due consideration. The speaker, therefore,
proposes to examine some of the arguments advanced by the
opponents of valuation to see if the objections most generally brought
forward are insuperable.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some critics of valuation go so far as to say that engineers cannot
make a close valuation of even the purely physical property. For
instance, Mr. W. H. Williams, Vice-President of the Delaware and
Hudson Company, in a paper on this subject,<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c003'><sup>[19]</sup></a> states that:</p>

<p class='c018'>"No engineer in estimating on the several important items of construction
work for the year will come within 10 per cent. of the total
aggregate cost. Many of the more important items are frequently
underestimated 25 to 50 per cent."</p>

<p class='c000'>He cites, as an especially good illustration, the Panama Canal, the
original estimate of the cost of which was $140,000,000, though the
present estimate is $300,000,000. Almost every one who has kept in
touch with that subject knows why the Panama Canal has cost more
than the original estimates, and that the greater cost is no reflection
on the judgment of the engineers who made such estimates. One
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>cannot always foresee what changes in plans may be made before construction
is completed, and would hardly expect the estimates of the
cost of a railroad to be adequate if they were made for a single-track
road and a double-track was built. In any event, there is a vast
difference in estimating the cost of an engineering work already completed
and one which has yet to be started, the difference being largely
in favor of a closer estimate of the completed work.</p>

<p class='c000'>Limitations are often placed on engineers, in connection with work
they do, which are afterward forgotten. The speaker was asked not
long ago to prepare a report in connection with the valuation of a
large railroad property. The time within which the results were
required was very limited, and the methods used in the valuation
necessarily had to be a combination of the inventory method and
reliance, in a great many matters, on the judgment of those making
the appraisal. Undoubtedly the result obtained was entirely adequate
for the purpose for which it was required, but would hardly stand if an
attempt were made to use it as a basis for an argument before a Court
of law or a public service commission, though it would not be beyond
the range of the experience of many engineers to have a matter of this
kind brought forward some time in the future as an absolute statement
of fact, with no reference to the way in which the work was done.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is inevitable, of course, that engineers will differ in their opinions
as to some details of methods of making an inventory of the property
of a railroad or other public service corporation, and also as to exactly
what unit prices should be applied, but in general it is safe to say
that any engineer of proper experience and training can make a satisfactory
appraisal of the value of the physical property of a railroad,
and that if two or more such competent fair-minded engineers,
unhampered by any consideration of the purpose for which it is to be
made, should make such an appraisal, the variation in the result would
be so small as to be negligible. The speaker, however, does not entirely
agree with the author, that the purpose for which the appraisal is
to be used should be entirely ignored by those who are making it.
There can be little doubt as to the propriety of using a properly made
physical valuation as a basis for taxation, or as information for the
owners, although there may be some as to the methods whereby the
so-called intangible values are to be determined in these cases, or even
whether they should be considered at all. The greatest difference of
opinion arises when an attempt is made to regulate the issue of stocks
and bonds, or to fix the rates which should be charged for transportation,
on the basis of a physical valuation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Arguments for and against rate regulation revolve in a circle, and,
apparently, there is no starting point which will satisfy every one.
The Courts have ruled that the railroads are entitled to such rates as
will enable them to earn a fair return on the value of their property;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>the railroads claim that the only way to determine this value is on
the basis of the earning capacity; that is, one side claims that the
rates must be based on the value and the other that the value should
be based on the rates. It is evident, however, by this time, that the
railroads must submit to regulation, therefore a way must be found
to break into the circle, and it would seem to be incumbent on them
to direct their energies along lines which will tend to make such
regulation fair and just rather than to oppose it entirely. There is
little claim that unduly large dividends are paid, but there is a feeling
in the mind of the public that the railroads are over-capitalized. Is
it not possible, therefore, to break into the circle at this point, and
decide, by means of a proper valuation, as to the fairness or otherwise
of the capitalization? The objection to this, on the part of the railroads,
is that the value of the purely physical elements is by no
means the whole value of their property, but that something should
be added for the so-called intangible values.</p>

<p class='c000'>To emphasize the difficulties of appraising the intangible values in
any way which will permit the application of such value to the
determination of rates for transportation, the opponents of physical
valuation cite what is now the familiar instance of two mythical roads
between the same termini, the first with good alignment and easy
grades following a valley, and the second forced into the mountains,
having not only heavier grades and more curvature, with consequently
a higher cost of operation, but also more expensive construction. The
value of the purely physical features of the former, of course, would
be much less than those of the latter, but its actual value as a property
would be greater. How then should the rates on the two roads be
fixed? The fallacy of using this example as an argument against
physical valuation as a basis for rate-making is in assuming that there
would be two railroads built under such circumstances, with no other
features than the two termini and the line between.</p>

<p class='c000'>One has only to call to mind such examples of competing lines as
those of the Denver and Rio Grande between Denver and Salt Lake,
the Union Pacific between Cheyenne and Ogden, the Lackawanna and
New York Central between New York and Buffalo, or many others,
to realize that there are, on all roads of this nature, many other
factors than the actual cost of operating through trains between the
termini, which determine the through rates.</p>

<p class='c000'>One would hardly suppose that at this late date any one believes
that it is proposed to use only the value of the purely physical property
of railroads as a basis for rate regulation, yet the <cite>New York Sun</cite>, a
paper of national prominence and usually most ably edited, devoted
a column of its editorial page<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c003'><sup>[20]</sup></a> to a discussion intended to show that
rate regulation, based on physical valuation alone, was an impossibility.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>In addition to citing the example given above, the following is put
forward as the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">reductio ad absurdum</span></i> of the argument for rate regulation
based on physical valuation. It is said:</p>

<p class='c018'>"Suppose there are two bridges over the Ohio, the <em>cost of the construction
of each being the same</em>, one between Cincinnati and Newport
and the other twenty miles below where there is nothing but a village
on either shore.... On what basis would the proponents of
physical valuation, as the determining value in rate making, adjust a
toll charge on these respective bridges?"</p>

<p class='c000'>The example is far-fetched, and in no way applicable to the question
of the adjustment of rates on railroads, but inasmuch as it is
seriously put forward from a responsible source, it seems worth while
to consider it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Assuming, as apparently the propounder does, that the proposition
is uncomplicated by any questions of franchises, public rights in the
land on which the bridge and its approaches are built, etc., then there
is no question but that the owners of either bridge have a perfect right
to charge what toll they please. On the other hand, suppose the permission
of the War Department, or some other governing body, had to
be obtained in order to build piers in the river, or even to build the
bridge at all; the argument used in asking for this permission is that
the bridge is needed as a public convenience; or it is desired to occupy
certain streets for the approaches, again is used the argument of public
convenience, and so on. These privileges are granted on the tacit
understanding, at least, that the public convenience is to be served,
and the Courts rule that, in such cases, in consideration of the equity
which the public has in the property by reason of the rights granted, a
fair return on the value of the property, but no more, should be the
basis for establishing the rates of toll. Would the <cite>Sun</cite> claim that the
value of the rights and franchises given by the public in such a case,
be included in the value of these bridges, and that a higher total
income should be derived from one bridge than the other because the
value of the streets on which the approaches had been built is greater
in one case than the other; or that a greater income should be derived
in one case than another because the cities furnish more people than
the villages? Is there any particular reason, except for the slightly
larger depreciation and cost of maintenance, and, bearing in mind the
fact that both bridges cost the same, why, if there is ten times as much
traffic on one bridge as on the other, the toll should not be proportioned
accordingly, to provide the same income on each?</p>

<p class='c000'>If the <cite>Sun</cite> had imagined a bridge built by private individuals, with
their own money, between two villages, the inhabitants of which, at
the time the bridge was built, having been willing to grant almost
any franchises or privileges in order to get the bridge, the villages in
course of time growing to large cities, and the old bridge having been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>replaced by a heavier modern structure, the example might have been
more nearly comparable to the railroad situation. In this case, the
original toll, of say 10 cents a head, may have, in the early days, only
barely returned a meager rate of interest on the investment, or even for
some years resulted in a deficit. Would the <cite>Sun</cite> uphold the owners of
the bridge if, since the villages have grown to cities, they still insisted
on collecting the original toll, if it could be shown that a new bridge
could be built and would be a paying investment with a toll of, say,
2 cents, except for the fact that the original bridge was built in the
only location where it was practical to build a bridge at all? Or is it
reasonable to say that the foresight and energy of the owners of the
bridge, even though it may have been one of the principal factors in
enabling the villages to grow into cities, entitle them to capitalize
their enterprise on the basis of a 10-cent toll? It cannot be denied
that the energy and foresight of the original builders should be
recognized in fixing the rate of toll, but there is a limit to the value
of this, and it is because of the feeling on the part of the general
public that the capitalization of similar intangible values on the part of
the railroads and other public service corporations is too large, which,
whether true or not, has caused the present agitation against them. If
the capitalization is reasonable, there must be some way to demonstrate
the fact, and it seems as if a properly made physical valuation, with
due allowance for the intangible values, is at least a step in the right
direction.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <cite>Sun</cite> states in its editorial that:</p>

<p class='c018'>"The scheme of physical valuation, as a basis for rate making, is
flatly rejected as unworkable by practically all the ablest railway authorities
of the country, and that the only true measure of value is the earning
capacity."</p>

<p class='c000'>To quote only one, namely: Dr. Emory R. Johnson, who is generally
regarded as an authority and not by any means predisposed in
favor of the public as against the railroads, it is found that he states
in his "American Railway Transportation" that:</p>

<p class='c018'>"The earning capacity of the railroad cannot be equitably or logically
made the sole criterion of value, because the rates, and hence the
earnings, should depend to some extent, at least, upon the amount of
capital justly entitled to profit."</p>

<p class='c000'>It would seem to be self-evident that the earnings alone, either
gross or net, are not necessarily an indication of the value of the road.
Gross earnings are not, because, if a minimum proportion of them is
used for maintenance and betterment, the value of the property will
steadily decrease; whereas, if the opposite policy be followed, it will
increase. On the same principle, the net earnings offer no criterion as
to the manner in which the property has been kept up, and alone are,
therefore, no measure of its true value.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>As an example of the arguments used by some of the opponents
of physical valuation, the following quotations are made from an
article by Mr. Henry Fink, Chairman of the Board of the Norfolk
and Western Railway.<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c003'><sup>[21]</sup></a> Referring to the fluctuation in the costs of
construction, he says:</p>

<p class='c018'>"As the cost of materials and labor fluctuates ... it follows
that what may be a fair valuation of a railroad one year may not be
so one or two years later. Hence, it would be necessary to make new
valuations from time to time."</p>

<p class='c000'>Further, in the same article, referring to a valuation based on the
market value of bonds and stocks, he says:</p>

<p class='c018'>"Unlike the physical valuation, this method has a rational basis....
It is true that prices of stock fluctuate—at times violently—but
this difficulty can be overcome in a measure by using the average
prices for long periods."</p>

<p class='c000'>It is strange that it did not occur to so able a man as Mr. Fink
that the value of the physical property might also be based on average
prices for long periods; the cost of railroad construction and equipment
as a whole does not fluctuate nearly so violently as the stock market.</p>

<p class='c000'>The report on "The Basis of Unit Prices,"<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c003'><sup>[22]</sup></a> by W. D. Pence, M. Am.
Soc. C. E., the Engineer of the Wisconsin Railroad Commission, in
connection with the Appleton Water-works case, is an excellent
example of a fair and impartial study of this phase of the subject, and
the conclusion of the Commission in this matter can only be regarded
as reasonable by any one who is disposed to be at all fair-minded.
It says:</p>

<p class='c018'>"If the standard by which the reasonableness of charges is to be
determined should fluctuate with the market prices of material, labor
and land, no schedule of rates could be established for any length of
time, for, under the circumstances, a rate that would be reasonable
to-day might be very unreasonable to-morrow. The principles of the
law applicable to the subject certainly involve no such absurd
consequences."</p>

<p class='c000'>Another instance of an argument based on technicalities is found
in the <cite>Railway Age Gazette</cite>.<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c003'><sup>[23]</sup></a> In an editorial on Valuation and Rate
Regulation, it is said:</p>

<p class='c018'>"It has been supposed in the past that rate-making is an exercise
of judgment. It seems to be assumed by many that after a valuation
has been made it will be merely an exercise in mathematics. Suppose
the value of a railway for state purposes is $50,000,000. Then, on this
theory, all that will have to be done will be to multiply this amount
by 6 per cent.—or whatever may be regarded as a fair return—and so
adjust the rates as to enable the road to earn, say, $3,000,000 a year,"
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>but, the writer goes on to ask, "how are the specific rates to be fixed? A
great majority of those who advocate valuation say that they should
be based on the cost of the service. The proper method, then, would
be to ascertain the exact cost of hauling each commodity and then base
rates on these ascertained costs, making them just high enough to
allow the road a fair return."</p>

<p class='c000'>Then the article goes on to point out the difficulties of doing this,
which of course we all know, and finally concludes that: "The theory
of basing rates absolutely on the cost of service is unjust and impracticable."
In the present state of the art this is probably true, but
why is it necessary to change the present theory of rate-making
because the rates are to be lowered or raised? If, for instance, it is
shown that it is necessary to reduce the rates sufficiently so that the
net earnings will be reduced, say, approximately 10%, is it beyond the
capacity of the traffic officials of a railroad to adjust their rates
accordingly?</p>

<p class='c000'>In an editorial in another part of this same issue the <cite>Gazette</cite>
advocates the raising of rates to meet higher prices of supplies and
higher wages; it is surely as feasible to lower rates as it is to raise
them, and, even though it were necessary to base rates on the cost
of service, it does not seem as if that would be entirely impractical,
inasmuch as it is the whole argument advanced for raising the commutation
rates on the railroads entering New York City. Will the
<cite>Gazette</cite> say that the arguments put forward by these railroads are all
wrong? Mr. Fink, in the article<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c003'><sup>[24]</sup></a> already referred to, states:</p>

<p class='c018'>"It cannot be said that ... railroads make tariffs; they can
only adjust them to varying conditions."</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c018'>"Adjusting freight rates is practical work of men who have special
training for it and large experience. They may not all be able to
explain underlying principles, such as the value of service, but they
have used this principle for years, and apply it, intuitively in every
case which comes before them."</p>

<p class='c000'>Surely this body of men is equal to whatever adjustment may be
necessary. Rates will probably never be arranged to suit every individual
shipper; but if the people, as a whole, believe that the railroads
are fairly capitalized on a reasonable basis of value, and the rates, in
the aggregate, are adjusted so that unduly high profits are not made,
individual complaints of injustice may easily be taken care of.</p>

<p class='c000'>The most important considerations affecting the regulation of railroad
rates arise in attempting to fix the amount which shall be considered
a fair return on the investment. If a certain rate of interest
is fixed as the maximum which may be earned, all incentive toward
improvement or progress is removed. The effect of this would be, of
course, to retard all development. Once a railroad was earning its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>legal rate of interest, there would be no necessity of cutting down
grades, building larger locomotives to handle larger trains, investigating
the economics of operation and location, in order to introduce the
thousand and one economies which are being developed day by day, or
for our railroad presidents to lie awake nights thinking how they are
to save that million dollars a day for the benefit of the always ungrateful
shipper. This objection against rate regulation, and incidentally
against physical valuation, can undoubtedly be overcome. One proposal
which has been made is somewhat along the lines on which it is
proposed to finance the New York Subways, the profits to be divided
between the railroads and the State, after a certain rate of interest
had been earned. There is nothing novel about this, as several railroad
charters have been granted with a provision that all earnings, over
an amount necessary to provide a certain rate of interest, should be
paid to the State. Another suggestion<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c003'><sup>[25]</sup></a> is that the reasonable rate of
return be fixed as a percentage of the gross income, irrespective of the
amount of capital required to produce it. There are probably other
ways in which this might be worked out and adjusted, and this phase
of the subject surely does not present any insuperable objections.</p>

<p class='c000'>That the railroads have little to fear, in regard to capitalization,
from a properly made valuation, is shown by the results in the State
of Washington, where the valuation was undertaken solely for the
purpose of fixing rates, the result being a determination of the market
value of the three principal railroads of the State—the Northern
Pacific, Great Northern, and Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company—at
an amount considerably in excess of their capitalization.<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c003'><sup>[26]</sup></a>
It is true that rates were lowered in this case on some commodities,
but it does not necessarily follow that every change of rates on the
basis of valuation must be toward a lower scale. Railroad rates are
low and have stayed low while the cost of everything else has been
raised, and yet, while this fact is well known to the general public, they
still believe that, in some way or another, the railroads are getting or
have been getting more than their proper share of profits. Evidently
there is something wrong somewhere, and it is not going to be set
right by calling the public fools and ridiculing their presumption for
meddling in any way with railroad affairs. Mr. F. W. Whitridge, the
Receiver of the Third Avenue Railroad, of New York, while stating<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c003'><sup>[27]</sup></a>
that he had only just discovered that there was such a thing as valuation,
at the same time held up the whole scheme to ridicule, though he
admitted that:</p>

<p class='c018'>"The people of this country have, I think wisely, made up their
minds, in consequence of great corporate abuses, that public service
corporations should be subject to regulation, etc."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>He nevertheless ridicules the efforts of the authorities, particularly
their endeavors in the matter of valuation, with its "irreverence for
facts." They seem, he says, "to be singing the song of the Banderlog
who dreamed of</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c028'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"'Something noble, grand, and good</div>
      <div class='line'>Won by simply wishing we could.'"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Valuation, however, has gone far beyond the point where it can
be considered a visionary scheme, or can be held up to ridicule; and
it has been worked out far enough to show, at least, that there is a
rational basis, on which a determination of values can be made, which
will do justice to both sides; furthermore, the Supreme Court of the
United States has not only ruled that valuation must necessarily
be precedent to rate regulation, but has gone so far as to specify
at least some of the elements which must be taken into account, and
it may be worth while noting that, in spite of the author's criticisms
of the Washington State Valuation, it is the only one, thus far, in
which an attempt has been made to comply with the rules laid down
by this Court. The results in Washington, however, indicate clearly
the need of regulation of the railroads, as a whole, and not varied
regulation by individual States of the parts of systems within the
borders of each.</p>

<p class='c000'>Arguments on either side can be prolonged indefinitely, and many
good reasons for and against physical valuation are advanced from
time to time, just as they may be on any proposition. Some of the
principal objections have been referred to here in an endeavor to show
that they are not insuperable; the point which concerns us now is that
to-day we are confronted with a fact and not a theory, and that fact
is that the railroads are going to be regulated, and that their proper
development is held back and general business is hampered by the
feeling of uncertainty as to the outcome. Physical valuation is not a
panacea for all evils, but a properly made valuation of the physical
elements, with a due allowance for the intangible values, based
possibly on some such method as that developed by the Washington
State Commission or by Professor Adams in Michigan, is surely as
good a way of breaking into the circle of argument as any that has
been proposed thus far.</p>

<p class='c000'>The equipment of freight trains with air brakes and safety
couplers was practically forced on the railroads by the pressure of
public opinion led by laymen, yet one will hardly find a railroad man
now who will not admit that this is good practice, not only from the
standpoint of safe operation, but from that of economy as well. The
early attitude of the railroads in this matter is already being quoted by
the advocates of valuation, and inasmuch as we have to admit, as we
surely do, that a start is going to be made somewhere along the line
of obtaining some more definite information in regard to the true
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>relation of the value, capital, and profits, of railroad properties, than
the mere statement by the railroads themselves that they are all that
is good and fair, would it not be wise on their part to do all they can
to have the start made properly rather than oppose it? Some of the
most prominent and progressive railroad men of the country have
already arrived at the point of believing and saying that regulation
properly carried out may not be an unmixed evil, in fact, would probably
be beneficial, but they still balk at valuation, without, however,
suggesting any other means whereby the general public is to obtain
the information on which to base an intelligent opinion as to how such
regulation is to be carried out.</p>

<p class='c000'>The speaker does not for a moment underestimate the difficulties
incident to the determination of the intangible values, or forget the
difference between the problem presented by the comparatively new
lines in the State of Washington and a valuation of, say, the Pennsylvania
Railroad or the New York Central. No one who gives any real
thought to the problem pretends that the value of a railroad is the
value of its purely physical property; but, because the matter of
determining the intangible values is difficult and complicated, is it
necessary that we should sit back and fold our hands and say "it can't
be done"; that in the whole country there is no man or body of men,
or engineers, if you please, with brains and ability enough to solve the
problem? As for cost, is it not worth $10,000,000, which is more than
$40 per mile for all the railroads in the country, or about three times
as much as the cost of the most careful appraisals yet made, to have
the question put once and for all on a stable basis, satisfactory to all,
if the problem be approached in a fair, broad-minded, common-sense
way, by engineers big enough to command the respect of both sides?
Aside from the question of rate regulation, is it not worth this much
to the railroads of the country to be able actually to prove that the
amounts at which they are capitalized are reasonable, as in the great
majority of cases they probably are?</p>

<p class='c000'>There are one or two points which, it seems to the speaker, cannot
be too strongly emphasized:</p>

<p class='c000'>First, that valuations properly made may be the means whereby
confidence may be restored, not only in the mind of the general public,
but in that of the investor; but, in order to obtain this result, the
railroads should urge, with all the power they possess, the necessity
of having such valuations made by a body of men, some of whom, at
least, should be engineers, big enough to entitle their opinions to the
respect of both sides, and thoroughly qualified by training and experience
for the work.</p>

<p class='c000'>Second, that, as far as possible, regulation should be general or
national, so as to avoid the complication of dividing all roads at the
State lines, and of having different regulations in different States.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>Third, that there need not necessarily be any relation between rate
regulation and rate-making. Rate regulation can well be confined to
rates in the aggregate, rate-making applies to the adjustment of
individual rates, and must necessarily be the work of men well versed
in all the varied elements which control it and the particular conditions
affecting the business of each particular road. The speaker believes
that valuations made in this way and with these objects in view will
do no harm to the railroads, and will do much to restore confidence
and give us the much needed peace and quietness to carry out necessary
development.</p>

a period of regulation and taxation of public service corporations, and
the only question is whether they shall be regulated and taxed with a
full understanding of the investment involved, or by arbitrary methods,
such as the 2 cents per mile passenger rate, which has been so popular
in many States, under widely different conditions and irrespective of
the cost of the service.</p>

<p class='c000'>The time would seem to have arrived when the thoughtful public
service corporation manager would welcome a fair valuation of the
company's property, as protection against legislation conceived in
ignorance of the capital invested.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Relation Between Railroads and Other Properties.</em>—The relation
between appraisals of railroad and of water, gas, and traction companies
is very close, and the same general principles apply. In the
former, however, it is complicated more often by the fact that the
lines of a railroad extend through many States, with terminals in one
or two, and, further, that the railroads have many subsidiary, controlled,
or dependent companies, such as coal, lighterage, terminal, car,
warehouse, contracting, elevator, stock yard, and supply companies,
often owned, wholly or in part, by men in the railroad management.
Agreements with these companies may greatly affect the non-physical
values, as determined by the methods advocated in this paper, which
may otherwise be sound.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Valuation of All Properties.</em>—The author says that the valuation
of all railroad properties in the country "would be of interest." It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>would be more; it would be of value infinitely greater than the cost.
The mere presence of light prevents many vices, and this is as true
in corporation practices as in the streets. It is in accord with Dr.
Woodrow Wilson's "pitiless publicity"; and, which is, perhaps, more
important, it is the basis, or should be, of all legislation concerning
the regulation of these great highways.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>One and Only One Fair Value.</em>—Nothing in Mr. Riggs' paper is
of more value than his insistence that there is one and only one fair
value of the physical property of a railroad, no matter for what
purpose it is to be used. How futile are the misdirected efforts of
those who would have it otherwise, for, no matter what the purpose
of the appraisal may be, who can foresee the use that may be made
of it when it becomes public property?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Cost of Reproduction.</em>—Cost of reproduction less depreciation seems
to be the established method—that recognized by the Courts—for
arriving at the value of the physical property. Cost, as the author
contends, can only be an element in determining the present value,
for the owner of a stone bridge has as much right to any appreciation
in the value of masonry as the owner of land has in the increased
value of his property; and, though the cost early in the life of the
structure is usually near its value, it may lose that position. What
relation exists between the value of the Pyramid of Cheops and its cost?
Now, as then, our unit measure of value is changing. Cost is certainly
of historic interest, but present value is the subject for present uses.</p>

<p class='c000'>The points in favor of inspection to determine the physical condition
of the object to be valued are convincing, where the structure may
be readily inspected. Mortality tables mean little without a history of
maintenance. With perfect maintenance there would be no physical
depreciation.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Maintenance versus Depreciation.</em>—Depreciation and maintenance
are interdependent, so much so that some engineers have advocated
dropping the term, "depreciation," and substituting "deferred maintenance."
A little thought will make this clear. While this term would
not apply in the case of a single rail or car, it is not illogical when
applied to a system, built and renewed piecemeal and maintained at
a certain standard of usefulness, that is, on all well-managed undertakings
of magnitude, units are constantly being replaced, thus maintaining
a standard of efficiency. This standard, on the entire system,
is usually found to be between 70 and 90% of the cost of reproduction.
Some items are even improved, and the cost is charged to the maintenance
account, such as that referred to in the paper as "consolidation
and adaptation" of roadbed; and only a few, such as steel rails, steadily
and progressively become less useful, and even these have a bottom
value, that of scrap steel. Nor are examples numerous where all the
rails are laid at one time, and they are extremely rare where all are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>replaced at approximately the same time. When the rails on a street
or section are renewed, the cost cannot properly be charged to capital
account, except in so far as the new rails are of a more valuable type
than the old ones; for, if this were done, there would be no limit
to the capitalization as time goes on. Furthermore, the moment it is
admitted that, by reason of a change in the art, we may have depreciation
through obsolescence, we admit that through a change in the art
we may have appreciation through the opposite of obsolescence. This
being the case, the use of "mortality tables" to determine present
value is misleading, unless it is done with the full itemized accounts
of maintenance, which are seldom, if ever, available. The author's
position in regard to the need of inspection of each item is well taken.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Dead versus Live Properties.</em>—These, perhaps, are not happy expressions,
but they serve to emphasize a vital distinction which must
be made in the valuation of properties. The difference may be as
great as between a corpse and a man; here, also, the distinction is
hard to define. We say the soul has departed, or the spark of life
is extinguished, but these expressions do not contain a satisfactory
scientific definition. So, as Mr. Riggs points out, the physical property
of a going business may not be valued as so much junk, even if the
non-physical values are to be determined separately.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>The Franchise a Contract.</em>—The Courts hold a franchise to be a
contract, something often forgotten, both by the public and by corporations.
The speaker, however, understands this only to mean, even
where the franchise is in perpetuity, that the property of the corporation
cannot be taken for public use without just compensation. In a
sense, then, there can be no such thing as a perpetual franchise. Using
the word franchise with its restricted meaning, the unreasonableness
of the rates may be measured by the value of the franchise.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Physical versus Non-Physical Values.</em>—The following division has
been made by the author between physical and non-physical property,
for the purpose of valuation:</p>

<p class='c018'>"That the Physical Value, or present value of the physical property,
should fairly represent the actual capital invested in the property at
the date of appraisal; that it should be made up of the sum of the
various elements which constitute the cost of reproducing the property
together with any appreciation which may have been added to any of
them, less all depreciation.</p>

<p class='c018'>"That the Non-Physical Value is the difference between the 'fair
value' as defined by the Courts, or the reasonable value of the property
as a business or producing property, and the physical value, or actual
present worth; and that the only proper method for determining such
values involves a study of income accounts.</p>

<p class='c018'>"This Non-Physical Value may be: positive, or a value in excess
of the physical property, or negative, or less than the physical value.
In the case of a property having a negative intangible value, a deduction
should be made from the physical value."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>This division is convenient but arbitrary. It is the division of
an engineer rather than of an economist; for these so-called non-physical
values are like the breath of a man's life; without them,
the physical value is like the discarded body. Again, the use of
negative non-physical values, while convenient, may not be wholly
logical. These remarks are not directed at Mr. Riggs, for he is careful
to say that he is dealing only with active enterprises, and not with
those which are inert, and the speaker realizes that he is not attempting
primarily to build up a logical argument, but to formulate certain
rules to overcome practical difficulties met by all who have attempted
valuation work. As many who have not given this matter much
thought are apt to be misled by the distinction made between physical
and non-physical values, they should bear in mind that the line between
them is like the equator, an imaginary one.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Water.</em>—"The water is as much a part of the cost of putting that
line there as the rails," remarked a corporation official, of admirable
character and wide experience, pointing to a trolley line from the
window of a Pullman car; and, bearing in mind what he meant by
"water," this is undoubtedly so. The cost of promoting the enterprise,
the discount on the hazard, the loss of interest during its infancy, the
labor of building up the undertaking—these are all real elements of
cost, and may remain in the property as value, but, like all other
items of cost, they have their reasonable limits, which, in each individual
case, can be determined within narrow bounds.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Purpose of a Valuation.</em>—As Mr. Riggs points out, there are four
reasons for a valuation: Taxation, rate-making, purchase, and control
of the issue of securities, one of which is usually the primary cause
for the valuation being made; and he argues that there can be but one
"fair value" of the physical property, whichever of these reasons may
prompt the appraisal. This is fundamental, for "fair value" is used
in the sense of true value, which, to the writer, seems to be a more
apt expression. It is rather surprising that it does not appear in the
paper. Its use, of course, is old; in the Constitution of New Jersey,
1875, we find: "Property shall be assessed for taxes under general
laws, and by uniform rules, according to the true value." Each of the
three matters, taxes, rates, and authorized capitalization, are interdependent
and, in the long run, cannot be considered separately. This
can be emphasized by a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">reductio ad absurdum</span></i>: Modern civilization
is so dependent on transportation by rail that unquestionably all taxes
could be raised by assessment on the railroads, if these roads were
allowed to fix their rates and were protected in the collection of them;
but how would this method differ from that of the Romans, of farming
out the collection of taxes? Not materially, and no one advocates
a return to that method. This is absurd, but it serves to emphasize the
relation between taxes and rates. Taxes can only come from the rates.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span><em>Overhead Charges versus Unit Values.</em>—There is much in various
parts of this paper concerning overhead charges, but very little about
the items considered in determining the unit values or unit prices
used; and does not the latter greatly affect the former? For example,
in discussing the Michigan appraisal, the author says:</p>

<p class='c018'>"For many items, such as clearing, grubbing, earthwork, masonry,
etc., the price was fixed by agreement during the discussion at a figure
which represented the fair average cost of this particular item during
the 5-year period preceding the appraisal."</p>

<p class='c000'>The "fair average cost" under what conditions? This word "cost"
is understood by different men in as many different ways as the word
value. Mr. Riggs very clearly gives the items included in "fair
value" as finally arrived at by him, but it would seem to be as
important to define "fair cost" as used in arriving at the unit prices,
for otherwise the chain has a weak link.</p>

<p class='c000'>What may be considered a fair cost per unit of measure for a
particular item differs greatly: First, with the point of view and
breadth of horizon of the man stating such cost; and second, with the
methods of letting contracts and accounting with which he may be
familiar, as applied to such items of work. Because of the first, a
fair average unit cost may mean one thing to a contractor, another
to a division engineer, still another to a chief engineer, and a fourth
to a manager or consulting engineer; and because of the second, the
understanding of the term may differ among men of the same class.
All of this quite aside from what may be termed the personal equation
of the individual. Thus the subject of overhead charges can only be
discussed profitably in the light of knowledge concerning what has
already been included in fixing the unit prices used. For example,
the element of hazard common to all construction, but differing in
degree on different classes of work, may be included in the unit cost
used, or it may be added as a percentage to resulting sums, but it
cannot rightly be included twice. This is equally true of other elements
of cost of a similar character.</p>

<p class='c000'>The foregoing is pertinent, for any valuation will probably be
attacked in the Courts, and the unit values will be one of the most
tempting points for assault, for the very reason that this wide difference
of understanding in regard to cost, and particularly in regard to
unit costs, exists. This same difference of understanding is usually
the reason for the wide difference in unit costs testified to by able
engineers and, consequently, for the distrust often felt for such testimony.
The methods followed in taking expert testimony usually work
to make "confusion worse confounded." The judge or layman, hearing
two engineers testify to widely different unit prices as a fair average
cost for certain work, forms a low opinion of their judgment, or worse,
whereas the real difficulty may, and usually does, lie in a different
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>understanding of the meaning of the term "cost," or "unit cost." To
the speaker, this seems to be the weakest point in an admirable paper.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Paving.</em>—Whether the value of the paving between and for a space
outside of the tracks is an element of value in a street-car line, or
whether the cost incidental to the construction and maintenance is in
the nature of a tax, is a much disputed point in all valuations of street-railway
properties, and an important one, for it may amount to
$15,000, or more, per mile. It is interesting to remember that the
custom of requiring street-railway companies to maintain the pavement
between the rails and for a space of about 2 ft. outside of them, which
has become almost universal, developed during the use of horses to draw
the cars, the animals causing great wear on that portion of the street.
This question of values is a difficult one. It would seem that the most
tenable position is that: If the fee to the pavement is not in the company,
and if the rule concerning cost of reproduction less depreciation
is to be followed, the cost of taking up and relaying the pavement is
an element of value in the physical worth of the track, for it would be
impossible to reproduce the track without incurring the cost of such
work.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>S. D. Newton, Assoc. M. Am. Soc. C. E.</span> (by letter).—The general
scope of this paper is admirable. The author's views and definitions
are unusually sound, clear, and forcibly expressed. To one minor
detail, however, the writer is unable to subscribe. Referring to "the
physical property element of value," he states that:</p>

<p class='c018'>"This consisted of those things which are visible and tangible,
capable of being inventoried, their cost of reproduction determined,
their depreciation measured, and without which the property would be
unable to produce the commodity on the sale of which income depends."</p>

<p class='c018'>Take the case of an industrial spur for some minor industry along
a line of railroad. It is often a question in the minds of the management
whether or not the car-load business done by such an enterprise
is sufficient in quantity to warrant the expense of a spur track. There
are probably other facilities in the neighborhood which could be used
to take care of this business at the expense of some inconvenience; in
a large proportion of cases, the railroad will handle the business anyway,
and the spur can in no sense be called a necessity. Still, it is visible,
tangible, and capable of being inventoried, and should be included in
an inventory of the property the same as any track or section of track
belonging to the Company. This may also be said of an extra settling
basin or filter bed in the case of a water-works plant. If such basin
or bed were not in existence, and a leak should occur in the original
plant, the business of supplying water to its customers could, in all
probability, be carried along in some manner until the break could be
repaired; nevertheless, such a tank or bed is desirable, and its value
should most certainly be included in an inventory.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>Take the extreme case of a piece of machinery which is utterly
broken down or so far out of date as to be entirely worthless for the
purposes for which it was designed. Yet such machinery has, at
least, a scrap value, and as such it should be included in the inventory
as part of the tangible assets of the concern at the date in question.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of course, in many instances, certain interests endeavor to have
inventoried items which should either be omitted altogether or included
at a much reduced valuation from that sought to be placed on them,
and, in such cases, the very best judgment of the appraising engineer
must be called into play in order that injustice may not be done to
either party; but to say, as Mr. Riggs' definition virtually does, that
nothing should be inventoried which can, either with or without inconvenience,
be dispensed with, is absurd, and the writer does not believe
that such is the meaning the author intended to convey. Probably, if
the word "economically" were inserted in the definition, it would more
nearly represent the proper idea.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>William V. Polleys, M. Am. Soc. C. E.</span> (by letter),—In his very
thorough and painstaking paper Mr. Riggs states that it is confined
to a discussion of methods for arriving at a correct figure of cost, and
disclaims any intention of considering the propriety of using said
figure when reached.</p>

<p class='c000'>Inasmuch, however, as he devotes the next eight or ten pages to
a dissertation on law, political economy, rate-making, finance, and
advice to railroad employees, with a word of encouragement to the
good, and firm reproof to the bad ones, it is fair to assume that he
intends this disclaimer in a Pickwickian sense, and that the real
intent of the paper is to show that the physical valuation of property
is, with certain determinative, corrective factors, a proper standard for
gauging taxation, bond issues, and kindred evils.</p>

<p class='c000'>Is it not a fact, however, that taxation is based on a much more
intangible structure, and that the net earnings must necessarily have
more to do with it than the physical valuation of the property—whether
it be that of a wicked public service corporation, or that of an
honest haymaker—rather on what their property can produce, than on
what it would cost to produce the property? Is it not rather a battle
of business acumen between the taxer and taxee, a battle which, among
other things, is regulated more or less by the fact that an extreme in
either direction will bring disaster to one or both, followed by the
inevitable reaction and readjustment?</p>

<p class='c000'>Take, for instance, an extreme case: A manufactory is erected on
comparatively worthless ground. A million dollars or more is invested
in a plant, with the result that surrounding real estate values go up
with a bound. Supposing that the manufacturer has not made any
previous arrangements for immunity, and the assessors are both acute
and honest, the property will be taxed for a large figure, which tax,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>if the factory is making money, will be paid, with more or less grumbling,
up to the economical breaking point. Suppose that, owing to a
sudden permanent change in business conditions, it becomes impossible
to operate this plant, and it is abandoned. A corps of experts may be
thrown into the mill, before the last employee has left the building,
and may carefully scrutinize and caliper the machinery, count the
bricks in the wall, tap the stay-bolts in the boilers, and bore into the
furniture to see whether it is solid or veneer, and when they are through
and their figures are all in, they have not arrived at anything that is of
the slightest use as a basis for a bond issue or taxation, and very
little that would be of use for sale. In such an extreme (but by no
means unheard-of) case physical value bears no relation to real value.</p>

<p class='c000'>This is not to say that a physical valuation is without worth, and
even great worth in some cases; it is merely offered as an opinion that
the physical value is in many (and probably most) instances a very
treacherous guide to the real value—a far poorer guide, as a general
rule, than the accounting department; a minor quantity, in fact.</p>

<p class='c000'>It seems doubtful whether there is a scientific way of arriving at the
true value of a going property by the physical-valuation route. There
is too large a percentage of values which, being intangible, are matters
of judgment. At best, the determination of value must be that of
opinion, and the worth of that opinion hinges principally on the
practical qualifications and disinterestedness of the person who gives it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Unfortunately, or fortunately, as the point of view may be, the
disinterested person is not apt to be qualified, nor the qualified person
to be disinterested, and it seems extremely probable to the writer that,
while weapons may be changed and excuses vary, the tax war will be
waged as of yore, and the fool and his money will continue along
diverging paths until something more ingenious than physical valuation
is invented, however well the valuation may be made.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>C. P. Howard, M. Am. Soc. C. E.</span> (by letter).—While there may be
no material differences of opinion as to the principles on which a
physical valuation should depend, such a detailed description of organization
and methods as that presented by the author should be of great
service to others undertaking similar investigations.</p>

<p class='c000'>It may not be amiss, however, to mention certain features affecting
the non-tangible values which should be more fully considered in any
general discussion of the subject.</p>

<p class='c000'>The author calls attention to one or more particulars in which
the methods of the Michigan appraisal may "fail as a method of
determining a value for use as a basis of rate-making." Later, after
quoting various court decisions, he dismisses this phase of the subject
with the words: "In view of these dicta, it is needless to argue whether
a rate of 6% or 10%, or 15%, or more, be reasonable."</p>

<p class='c000'>A value for purposes of rate-making might more properly be called
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>a "permissible value." The writer holds no brief for the corporations,
and would not like to fall under the imputation of being "apparently
incited by, either the direct interest of corporations, * * * or
an effort to confuse the subject of valuations," but will venture the
following, which, while it does not exactly represent any particular
case, it is hoped may be recognized as an illustration drawn from life.</p>

<p class='c000'>A, B, C, and their associates, being familiar with a certain territory,
its resources, transportation facilities, and growing development, believe
that the time has come to build another railroad through their
State or States. They have made careful estimates of the amount
of tonnage that may be expected from the development of its mines,
timber, farms, etc., and conclude as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'><em>First.</em>—The road, completed along the most approved lines, will
cost, with equipment, $50,000,000.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Second.</em>—It will take five years to construct and equip the road and
put it in fair running order.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Third.</em>—The traffic, when fully developed according to their hopes
and expectations, will eventually afford at usual tariffs a handsome
profit, say, from 8 to 12% per annum on the capital invested. This
condition, they believe, in all human probability, will be attained in
from 5 to 10 years after completion.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fourth.</em>—That half the traffic anticipated will pay 5% on the
investment.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fifth.</em>—They are obliged to admit (though the chances of this are
so remote as to be in their opinion negligible) that, due to unforeseen
causes, obstruction, competition, etc., there is a possibility that, as has
so often happened in the past, the enterprise may prove a financial
failure, or that the period of prosperity may be postponed so far into
the future as to amount to practically the same thing.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here is a bold undertaking; but were it $5,000,000 instead of
$50,000,000, the conditions would be essentially the same. Nevertheless,
they have the courage of their convictions and go ahead.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now, with all the risks and uncertainties attending an enterprise
of this sort, if the ultimate profits were limited in advance to 5 or 6%
on the capital invested, less depreciation, who but the Government
itself could afford to build a railroad?</p>

<p class='c000'>Evidently, when an existing railroad makes small additions from
time to time to extend or take care of its business, the risk is not so
great. Such extensions will continue more or less under any
limitations.</p>

<p class='c000'>For rate-making, it is evident that an appraisal based on earnings
will utterly fail of its purpose if made during the lean years immediately
following construction. If made some years later, when the
property has begun to pay, the risk and necessary financial loss of the
lean years should be remembered, as any one building a road in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>future will necessarily have the same problems to meet, together with
the expenses of interest, depreciation, loss from operation, etc., both
during the construction and the lean years following, all of which
must properly be considered a part of the real cost of constructing
and developing a property.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>J. E. Willoughby, M. Am. Soc. C. E.</span> (by letter).—The determination
of the cost of reproducing the property of any steam railway
involves, together with other items, an estimate of the present cost of:</p>

<p class='c018'><em>First.</em>—The acquirement of the right of way, to the extent, in the
form, and on the location of that held in connection with the
railway to be reproduced;</p>

<p class='c018'><em>Second.</em>—The construction thereon of the roadway, to the form
and dimensions, and of the materials which the roadway to be
reproduced exhibits; and</p>

<p class='c018'><em>Third.</em>—The seasoning and adaptation of the roadway to the state
of perfection which the roadway to be reproduced exhibits at
the time the estimate of cost of reproduction is made.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first conception, for fixing the cost of the several items, is to
consider the railway to be reproduced as being non-existent at the time
the estimate is made, but having the environment which then exists
along the operated railway, although that environment may be largely
of the railway's own creating. The cost of the right of way is to be
fixed as ungraded and unimproved property attached and forming a
part of the adjoining improved property, which adjoining property
will be entitled to receive, in addition to the market value of the land
taken, all consequential damages due to the taking off of the right of
way in the form and location that the land has actually been taken,
and for the purpose of railway construction and operation. This
adjoining property is to give credit on the consequential damages for
the incidental benefits which it derives, if any, from the construction
and operation of the railway.</p>

<p class='c000'>In fixing these values, the drift of public sentiment—the bias of
juries of view and of trial juries—at the time the estimate of cost
of reproduction is made must be considered, since that sentiment may
affect enormously the cost of the right of way. The amount to be paid
for a right of way is in the end that which a condemnation court will
award. The question as to whether or not the right of way was
originally donated can no more enter into the determination of the
cost of reproduction, for the purpose of lessening the estimate of cost
of acquiring the right of way, than the fact that donations of lands
or bonds (or of convict labor and slave labor, as in the South prior
to 1860) made by governmental authority or private enterprise, at
the time of the original construction, can be used to reduce the reproduction
cost of the excavation made in the formation of the roadway.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>No rule as to the sale of property for commercial purposes in the
vicinity of an operated railway can be rightfully adapted as covering
the line as a whole. While the cost of right of way through farm or
timber lands bears a general relation to the value of those for
agricultural purposes, where improvements thereon bear but a small
proportion to their total value, this relation is wholly wanting in
the cost of a right of way through a village or city or at any point
where the improvements on the property bear a large proportion to its
total value. The relation is also wanting where a right of way is
obtained through agricultural lands devoted to special purposes, like
that of country homes for the rich. It is also wanting where the right
of way is taken out of the narrow river lands in the Appalachian
Mountains, where the total value of the whole farm is dependent on
the small acreage of flat land along the river bank. The general rule
of prefixing a constant to the current selling price of lands, in order
to determine the estimated cost of right of way, should be limited to
agricultural and timber lands, and to those which, owing to their
extent, the carving out of the right of way does not wholly destroy
for the continuation of agricultural and timber operations.</p>

<p class='c000'>For villages and cities, and for lands devoted or adapted to special
purposes, an accurate estimate of the cost of reproduction of the right
of way can be determined only by a specific investigation of the conditions
in each community. While it is difficult to conceive all the
activities and sentiments which have growth in, from, and of railway
operation, as being in existence without the railway, it is only through
such an assumption that one can estimate correctly the make-up of
the items of cost of reproducing a railway as such railway may now
exist. To assume that the railway, not existent for the purpose of estimating
the cost of reproduction, will now receive the donations of
land and moneys that were made half a century ago, is merely going
back to a determination of what the road has actually cost; and that
is contrary to the intent of the theory of the cost of reproduction.
The conception of a parallel line is not correct, for it imposes thereby
a further burden on properties which have already contributed to the
public good, probably to an extreme extent, and gives an abnormal
cost for right of way, as shown when a railway seeks to enlarge its
terminals in a crowded community, or to find a new entrance into a
populous city.</p>

<p class='c000'>So, too, in estimating on the formation of the roadway, one must
consider the roadway to be reproduced as being obliterated—all cuts
and borrow-pits refilled, and all embankments and spoil banks removed
from the right of way—but all other lines of transportation, except
the railway to be reproduced, must be considered as being in existence
as they actually are at the date when the estimate of cost of reproduction
is made, and that such other lines of transportation are available
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>for bringing in machinery, tools, teams, materials, and supplies for the
construction of the railway to be reproduced. It is only by such an
assumption that the benefit of the improved means and methods of
construction now prevalent can be obtained; but it is not permissible
to estimate for the construction of a railway with different grades,
alignment, roadbed, widths, or with different materials than that of the
railway to be reproduced merely because such construction at this day
might be actually cheaper or better than to construct it in exact
duplication. For example, if the rock cuts on the roadway to be
reproduced be only 18 ft. wide, with ¼:1 slopes, one must not figure
on the greater economy of steam-shovel excavation, because the steam
shovel cannot be worked in cuts of that width; nor can the spoil from
such cuts be carried long distances to eliminate a possible solid-rock
borrow originally made elsewhere, because long hauls are practicable
in steam-shovel work, but wanting in excavations where the mule is the
transportation force. So, too, it is not permissible to estimate on reinforced
concrete bridges to take the place of more costly cut-stone
arches, if cut-stone arches are the structures that have been actually
built. The idea of cost of reproduction is not synonymous with the
idea of the cost of building a railway capable of serving the same
transportation purpose. If all our railways were to be built anew, in
the light of our present knowledge, and with our present traffic offerings
and financial resources, vast changes would be made in the character
of construction. The physical fact of existing construction prevents
a theoretical substitution of what is the best construction for any
community, together with its costs for the construction which was
actually made years ago.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the event that an estimate of reproduction costs be made for a
State as a whole, or for a great railway system as a whole, the conception
of reproduction is modified so that the construction may take
the form of progressive construction, the principal lines being built
first and the less important lines afterward. This method will require
the estimate for interest during the construction period to be greater.</p>

<p class='c000'>The money cost of the seasoning and the adaptation of the roadway
to such a condition as will permit heavy trains to be run at high
speeds, is great, but the amount is not readily ascertained. An estimate
of cost of reproduction, to be true, must consider this item; and
probably the more usual method of ascertaining it is to assume it to
be an amount in some proportion to the cost of the excavation. This
proportion will vary with the character of the material through which
and of which the cuts and fills are made, and with the methods of construction
necessarily adopted. There are many railways on which
this cost will exceed 25% of the total cost of excavation.</p>

<p class='c000'>After the estimate has been made, including the item for seasoning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>and adaptation, there should be added a contingent fund to cover the
omitted work, consisting of small borrow-pits and ditches, undetermined
foundations, unexpected conditions encountered, unavoidable "force
account" work, minor changes of streams and highways, damages to
adjoining lands due to the methods of construction and to diversion of
water, etc. This item will not exceed 5% of the cost of the roadway
if the estimate be accurately made.</p>

<p class='c000'>The more convenient form into which an estimate of cost of reproduction
of a steam railway is to be put is to follow the sub-accounts, as
prescribed by the Interstate Commerce Commission for Expenditure
for Road. Each item given in that accounting has a place in the
estimate. These comments are confined to the items covering the roadway,
namely, Right of Way and Station Grounds, Grading, Tunneling,
Bridges, Trestles, and Culverts.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Henry C. Adams, Esq.</span><a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c003'><sup>[28]</sup></a> (by letter).—To the writer this paper
seems to be the most complete and comprehensive discussion of the
general question of valuation of property invested in public service
industries that has come under his notice. It is especially important in
that it is a summary of the discussion on this most difficult subject
during the past ten years, and the writer thoroughly agrees with
the general conclusions reached by Mr. Riggs.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is one point, however, which might possibly have been
developed more completely, and that is the treatment of discounts,
which presents itself from time to time in the general discussion.
Mr. Riggs quotes with approval the following:</p>

<p class='c000'>"If a company can market its 50-year, 4 per cent, bonds at 90 per
cent. of par, it means that the company's credit is on a 4½ per cent.
basis; that it could market a like security paying 4½ per cent.
at par."</p>

<p class='c000'>This is, of course, correct as far as the mathematics of the proposition
is concerned, but it seems to overlook that peculiar psychology of
the market which enables a corporation to secure a larger amount of
actual cash for a given interest annuity when bonds are sold at a
discount than when they are sold at par.</p>

<p class='c000'>Aside, however, from the accuracy of the above quotation and of
Mr. Riggs' apparent acceptance of it as the final word on discounts,
one may ask if it recognizes all the elements necessarily involved in a
discussion of the problems raised by discount financiering. From the
literature of the subject one may read the following claims: Discount
is a measure of the risk involved in a new enterprise; discount is a
market adjustment that reflects the current value of money; discount
is a sacrifice of principal for a slightly reduced interest annuity;
discount is a dividend declared before the dividend is earned; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>many cases are cited in which a discount is merely a promoter's fee
for services rendered.</p>

<p class='c000'>The writer does not care to discuss at this time these various
points of view from which discounts may be regarded. They are mentioned
merely to suggest that the subject is not as simple as some
writers seem to think. Any valuation of public service industries,
from whatever point of view it may be regarded, must, from the
nature of the case, touch the problem of fundamental equities; and
one of the elements of this problem which has not as yet been fully
analyzed is this element of discounts. From the point of view of
taxation, such an analysis is not perhaps essential; but if the valuation
is to be used as a basis of determining reasonable rates, or as a
measure of reasonable capitalization, it seems to be essential.</p>

<p class='c000'>The writer is sure this discussion will not be construed as in any
sense a criticism on Mr. Riggs' paper; it is rather a suggestion of an
unwritten chapter in the literature of valuation. The American
Society of Civil Engineers is to be congratulated in securing from one
of its members so complete and satisfactory a discussion of the principles
and methods for the valuation of public service corporation
property.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Carl C. Witt, M. Am. Soc. C. E.</span> (by letter).—The appraisal of
the railway property in Michigan was a wonderful performance in a
great many ways, not the least of which was the thoroughness of the
work, considering the short time available, and the writer desires
to express his appreciation of this paper, as it is a valuable addition
to the meager literature on this subject.</p>

<p class='c000'>More recent appraisals, made by States traversed by the same railway
systems as those involved in the Michigan appraisal, have been
made with a freedom from opposition by railway companies due to the
educational effect of this pioneer work. Particularly is this true of the
recently completed appraisal, by the Board of Railroad Commissioners
of South Dakota, of the physical property of the railways in that
State, of which work the writer was the Engineer in charge. No
opposition was met; in fact, some of the railway companies had established
regular departments for furnishing inventories and appraisals,
had completed the necessary field work in South Dakota before the
inventory had been requested by the State, and were able to furnish
a very complete appraisal in a short time after the request for it
was made.</p>

<p class='c000'>This appraisal was made in compliance with an act of the Legislature
of 1907, which required the Board of Railroad Commissioners
to ascertain the true cash value of all the property of every railroad
company in South Dakota used in the operation and maintenance of
their respective roads. No attention was paid to the purpose of the
appraisal, but one of the first uses made of the information thus secured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>was in the litigation following the passage of an act by the Legislature
of 1909, prescribing a maximum passenger fare of 2 cents per mile
on all railroads operating within the State. In connection with a rate
case of this kind, some questions have been raised regarding proper
bases for land values, the use of an item for adaptation and solidification
as an element of physical value, the value of the intangible
assets, etc.</p>

<p class='c000'>The lands of all railway companies were appraised at a cost to
reproduce or re-purchase at the time of appraisal, regardless of the
original cost of the property. The sales method was used for determining
the market value of adjoining property. There has been a very
large land movement in South Dakota in the last five years, and as
most of the country is prairie, with similar soil over large areas, it was
not difficult to determine the average market value of the land for
farm purposes, at the date of the appraisal, and the gradual trend
of values for five years previous to that date. An average multiple
of 250% was used to arrive at the cost of reproducing or purchasing
the right of way. This multiple was based on investigations made
of recent right-of-way purchases, and inasmuch as there are no large
terminals in South Dakota, the same average multiple was used
throughout the State for both town and farm property, investigation
showing that town property could be secured for slightly less and
farm property for slightly more than the average multiple used.</p>

<p class='c000'>In each supplemental appraisal the land values will be corrected
to correspond to the changes in surrounding values, as the railway
company is entitled to any increase, due to natural causes, based on
the cost to reproduce at the time of appraisal. This is a well-established
theory, as shown by Mr. Riggs.</p>

<p class='c000'>No allowance was made for the item commonly known as "adaptation
and solidification," except in the item of contingencies and in
the consideration of the present value of the ballast. In some recent
appraisals, large sums, based on a percentage of the cost of grading,
have been allowed for this item. While there is no question that
large sums of money are expended in maintaining a safe track on
a new bank, and that this expense gradually diminishes as the roadbed
becomes solid, due to the pounding of the trains and the action
of the elements, this expense is, and properly so, charged to maintenance,
and is paid for out of the operating revenues. Now, in the
trial of a rate case, exhibits showing the operating expenses, including
maintenance charges, are introduced, and to include this same item
in the appraisal of the physical property leads to a duplication, for
if the passenger or shipper pays for this maintenance charge, it should
not be counted as an item of physical value as a basis for determining
what is a reasonable rate.</p>

<p class='c000'>The case is similar to that of a locomotive: When new, it is kept in
the vicinity of the shops, because trouble from lack of proper adjustment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>and weak parts is likely to develop, and the maintenance charges
may be much higher than a few months later when the machine has
"found itself" and, as an operating machine, is more efficient than
when new. However, no one will insist that it has an added physical
value in dollars and cents, or that the excess cost of repairs and maintenance
during its early life should be added to its cost of reproduction
now; in fact, it is a second-hand machine, and the maintenance
charges must be paid for out of its use.</p>

<p class='c000'>Generally, when a roadbed is turned over to the operating department
by the construction department, it is in good line and surface,
and if an appraisal were made at that time its condition would
be 100%; but as soon as it is placed under traffic, it begins to depreciate,
as shown by the fact that it requires constant attention to
keep it up. If the roadbed is cross-sectioned at each station and actual
quantities calculated from cross-section notes, there would be no depreciation,
but if the grading quantities are calculated from profiles of
the line, as constructed some time previously, and for a standard width
of sub-grade, with a percentage added for shrinkage, and allowance
made where banks have been widened, etc., it will probably be found
to exceed the actual measured quantities, because the action of the
elements in washing the slopes, the wearing of the shoulders of the
embankment due to foot traffic, etc., will show some depreciation in
quantities. It is common practice to carry the item for grading over
to the present-value column at 100%, or, with no depreciation. This
practice, together with the present condition of the ballast due to
maintenance, and that part of contingencies which covers washing of
slopes, filling of ditches, sink holes, etc., certainly takes care of all
adaptation and solidification which should enter into a valuation of
physical property.</p>

<p class='c000'>No appraisal was made of the intangible assets. A great many
arguments have been advanced for and against such an appraisal, and in
South Dakota it was held that the earning ability of any corporation
due to its franchise, strategic location, efficient organization, going-concern
value, etc., while perhaps an element of value to be considered
in a transfer of the property or if assessed on an income
basis, should not enter into a valuation which would be used for
determining a just and reasonable return on the investment, because
the greater the earning power the greater would be the return, and
that this condition would produce a never-ending increase in returns;
whereas, when the returns reach a point at which they will not
only pay a fair dividend on the investment, but take care of any
depreciation in the physical condition of the property and make all
needed improvements in roadbed, buildings, and equipment, demanded
by the traveling public, shippers, increased traffic, or natural causes,
they should be kept to that point. There are several hundred miles of
railway in South Dakota which have been built out of the surplus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>earnings of the parent corporation—in other words, with money supplied
by the traveling and shipping public—but which are owned by the
railways and on which they may earn another surplus for constructing
more extensions, etc., etc.</p>

<p class='c000'>The original South Dakota appraisal, as of June 30th, 1908, on
forms similar to those used in Minnesota, has been supplemented by
yearly appraisals corrected for all additions and deductions made during
the fiscal year. For this purpose a new set of forms<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c003'><sup>[29]</sup></a> was prepared,
with the various items classed in accordance with the "Classification
of Expenditures for Road and Equipment," as prescribed by the
Interstate Commerce Commission, and arranged so as to facilitate
showing the yearly changes.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>R. A. Thompson, Assoc. M. Am. Soc. C. E.</span><a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c003'><sup>[30]</sup></a> (by letter).—This
paper is considered by the writer to be the most complete treatise
ever written on the valuation of public service corporation property,
and the author deserves the sincere thanks of the entire Engineering
Profession and all others interested in this most important question.
Its presentation is most timely, in view of the agitation, particularly
on the subject of railroad valuation, which is now engaging the attention
of Congress and the law-making bodies of the several States, as
it contains much valuable information relative to decisions of Courts,
in addition to clear and concise expositions of the methods in vogue
for the appraisement of corporate property, etc.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is a fact—rapidly coming to be recognized by legislative and judicial
bodies—that the prescription and regulation of tolls, charges, and
assessments against public corporations cannot be made systematic
and intelligent unless there is provided some estimate of the value of
the property involved, based on the cost of its replacement or reproduction.
Particularly is this true of railroads; and such regulation of
the affairs of these corporations as has heretofore been essayed by
State and National commissions, has generally been on illogical bases,
unsatisfactory alike to the proponents and the companies. Results
have been had, it is true, after a fashion, but there have been endless
disputes and litigation, with the prime questions involved no nearer
solution than before. One has but to contemplate the varied and often
antagonistic legislation promulgated by the several States, relating
to corporation management, and the many rulings and decisions
of the different courts and commissions on the subject of regulation,
assessment, and adjudication of corporate rates, revenues, taxes, and
tolls, to become convinced of the complicated and tangled condition
of the situation, and to realize the necessity for the early establishment
of some logical basis on which to establish the fabric of corporate
control.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>While it is not maintained that an appraisement of the physical
property of public service corporations will be the panacea for all
such ills, the writer firmly believes with the author that such appraisal,
as a beginning, is absolutely necessary, and when effected on some
fair and reasonable basis, will contribute largely to the successful
solution of many of these intricate problems.</p>

<p class='c000'>With the estimate of the physical value of a property before it—which
represents money actually invested, together with such accruals
to costs as it may be determined that the owner is reasonably entitled
to have considered—any Court, tribunal, or commission is in a better
position to mete out impartial justice, whether it be the regulation of
a rate, the assessment of a tax, or the imposition of a fine.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although the author's experience in valuing corporate property
has been principally in connection with the Michigan appraisal of
railroads, and to him is largely due the credit for devising methods
for, and carrying forward to successful completion, this thorough and
most excellent work, it is refreshing to note his inclination to
give credit to the work of others along the same line in other States,
which, it is to be regretted, has not always been the case with writers
on this subject. There is no doubt that the work of the Michigan
and Wisconsin Boards of Appraisal—conducted under the advice and
direction of some of the most eminent and talented engineers and
economists in the United States, and practically without regard to
expense—is the most complete and perfect of its kind heretofore
attempted; yet there are many features in regard to the organization
and execution of its details about which there may be an honest
difference of opinion, as viewed by those who have been similarly
employed.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is but natural—as suggested by the author—to find the "individual"
character of the appraiser (which has been moulded by his
environment, training, and former service) reflected in his opinion,
and this would be most probable in the organization for, and carrying
on the work of, appraising a railroad property, which involves consideration
of practically every phase of engineering and economics.
The judgment of any man is essentially warped along the lines of his
experience, and he is necessarily biased and prejudiced in favor of
or against certain practice. As a consequence, therefore, it is not
reasonable to suppose that any one man, or set of men, can formulate
a system for valuing corporate property which will be perfect in all
its details, and be free from objection and criticism.</p>

<p class='c000'>The writer was employed for a number of years as Engineer for
the Railroad Commission of Texas, and had charge of the valuation
of railroad property under the Railroad Stock and Bond Law of that
State. A paper on the methods used by this Commission was prepared
by him and published by the Society.<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c003'><sup>[31]</sup></a> This Stock and Bond Law was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>enacted in 1893, and the railroads then existing were valued in 1894
and 1895. The average value of 8,860 miles was $15,844 per mile. This
valuation was made by Charles Corner, M. Am. Soc. C. E., now
Resident Engineer of the Rhodesia Railways, South Africa, and Mr.
H. J. Simmons, now General Manager of the El Paso and Southwestern
Railway System. The actual cost of this work is not available,
but is estimated at about $2 per mile. The engineers making the
appraisal secured maps, profiles, and all available information from the
offices of the railroad companies, including all the construction records
and estimates of quantities which were preserved. Appraisal was
made only after one of the engineers had made a personal examination
on the ground, accompanied by assistants to aid in measuring
structures and estimating quantities.</p>

<p class='c000'>All valuations made since 1895 have been of new railroads making
application for issuance of securities, and in all cases the deeds for
right of way and depot grounds, the contracts for construction, the
actual quantities of construction of all kinds, the plans and specifications
for all structures and construction, and all other information
which the engineer desired, were submitted by the railroad companies
to enable an accurate appraisal of the value of the property to be made.
It is not possible for valuations of this character to be made under
more favorable circumstances. Up to October, 1909, more than 3,500
additional miles had been valued, and in all cases the estimates limited
the securities which the companies might issue.</p>

<p class='c000'>Writers on railroad valuation have generally been inclined to discredit
the work of the Texas Railroad Commission and the system
of appraisal used by it. One writer, of more or less prominence, has
referred to it as the "cheap" method. While it may be true that
other appraisals have been more expensive, it is a fact that those of
the Texas Commission have served their purpose well, and the railroads,
as a rule, have made little complaint. As a matter of fact,
it is highly probable that the valuations of railroad property made
by the Texas Commission have been of greater utility, as far as the
public is concerned, than those of all other States combined, and,
at the same time, no injustice has been done the railroads.</p>

<p class='c000'>It appears that those who have interested themselves in investigating
the Texas method of railroad valuation—including the author—have
failed to construe the real meaning and intention of the Stock
and Bond Law. Apparently, it was passed for the purpose of limiting
railroad indebtedness—and is referred to by Mr. Riggs as serving
only this purpose—but while its effect has been to accomplish this
most successfully, its enactment carried with it a deeper significance.</p>

<p class='c000'>This law was passed at the same time as the General Railroad
Commission Act of the State, which gave to this Board absolute control
over all freight rates and tariffs, and also other powers not possessed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>at that time by any other State commission. The decisions of the
highest Courts at that time laid stress on the right of carriers to
maintain rates which would afford a reasonable return on stocks and
bonds outstanding. Hence, to delegate the regulation of rates to
any tribunal by any law which did not carry with it also the right
to supervise and restrict mortgage indebtedness to some reasonable
extent, appealed to the legislators as being essentially ineffective.
The effect of the law has been to reduce steadily the average outstanding
stocks and bonds of the railroad companies of the State
from an average of $40,802 per mile in 1894 to $31,910 in 1909—and
this, too, in the face of a recognized increase in the physical
value of the properties—thus depriving the railroads of one of their
most potent weapons of offense when contending against the Commission's
orders. It is a matter of common knowledge that the indebtedness
per mile of railroads of other States has increased greatly during
this period. It is also a fact that the railroads of Texas have,
except in rare instances, contended that injustice has been done them
in the enforcement of this law, and the market value of their stocks
and bonds has steadily risen. Also their physical condition is on a
par with that of railroads in other Southern and Western States,
and their incomes from operation are as substantial. The practice
of "watering" their securities has been effectually stopped, as regards
local issuance, and any interest which might have accrued on such
securities has been saved to the public.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has been contended that the Texas valuations of 1894-95 were
too low, and did not, even at that time, represent the fair value of
the properties. This is perhaps true to a certain extent, but it must
be remembered that the costs of materials and construction then
were less than at any time before or since; and, viewed from the
present-day standpoint, they seem to have been inadequate. It must also
be considered that real estate values throughout the entire State were
very low, compared with present values and with those of lands in other
States. Although the writer admits that the margin was very narrow,
still he is of the opinion that the valuations as made represented
closely the cost of reproduction of the physical properties at the time.</p>

<p class='c000'>The valuations of 1894-95 stand to-day on the Commission's records
as "the value of the property," except in cases where there has been
application and necessity for re-valuation. The machinery of the law
did not provide that these appraisals should be kept "up to date."
The mortgages on these railroads are still outstanding, and there has
been no call for another appraisal, except in a few instances. The
Commission has decided that in its opinion the "present value" of any
of the railroads already appraised is represented by the original valuation
plus the value of all permanent improvements and betterments
added. This principle has been carried out with those railroads which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>have applied for re-valuation for any purpose, and the Commission
has admitted the same in testimony which it has given before the
Courts.</p>

<p class='c000'>Since the appraisals which the Texas Commission makes are
primarily for the purpose of limiting indebtedness, and the carriers
are entitled to have these at least equal the cost of their property—the
investment with certain additions to cover promoters' profits—no
consideration can be given to depreciation of structures and equipment,
although the application for valuation and process of issuing
of securities may be had several years after completion. The writer
holds that there is strong argument in favor of not taking into account
"depreciation," and of estimating the value of the property as being
entirely "new," whatever purpose the valuation is proposed to serve.
This is apparent, as already stated, when the valuation is to serve as a
basis for limiting the issue of stock and bonds. Is there any logical
reason why a valuation for this purpose should not also serve—as far
as it pertains—as a basis for taxation or for regulating freight rates?
As far as the State is concerned—and to be consistent—should not
"one" valuation serve all purposes?</p>

<p class='c000'>Suppose that a State should create a board clothed with powers
of rate regulation, taxation, and authority to restrict indebtedness,
and also prescribe that it should appraise the value of the property of
the railroads, and use that appraisal as the basis for its acts. Would
it be logical for that board to make and apply one system of valuation
for one purpose and another system for another purpose?
Manifestly, it would have declared that a valuation was a "valuation"
for all purposes, at least as far as the physical property was concerned;
and, when devising a method for making its appraisals, it
should incorporate therein all the elements of value which might
apply logically to either purpose. The writer believes that "depreciation"
of roadbed and structures would have no place in such
an appraisal, on the one hand, nor its negative, but fully as intangible
and difficult of concrete estimate, "adaptation and solidification
of roadbed," on the other.</p>

<p class='c000'>It should not be understood that the writer maintains that taxation
boards should not go beyond the valuation of physical property
to arrive at a final basis for assessment. There are certain intangible
elements which should be taken into consideration when taxing property,
chief of which is the net income. It is only as far as physical
valuations apply in either case that he considers that there should
be uniformity.</p>

<p class='c000'>He does not approve at all of incorporating in an estimate of the
physical value of a railroad property such an element as "adaptation
and solidification of roadbed," which is credited with so much
importance in the Minnesota valuation. In the first place, such an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>element is incapable of being measured in tangible terms and reduced
to a dollars-and-cents basis; second, it cannot be reproduced in the
sense that other property is reproduced, and its value does not appear
in the capital account of the railroad; and third, it results from the
action of the seasons on the one hand, and the working over of the
roadbed by the maintenance forces on the other, the cost of which
appears in operating expenses. One is constrained to believe that the
engineer who insists on incorporating such an element in an appraisal
of the physical value of a railroad is hard put to find material
with which to swell his estimate. When noting the large difference
in value per mile of the railroads of Minnesota, as compared with
those of Michigan and Wisconsin—adjoining States—it would appear
that undue prominence had been given to this and similar factors.</p>

<p class='c000'>The writer's experience as appraising engineer for more than 10
years with the Texas Railroad Commission, and for the past 2 years
as a construction engineer—having built about 160 miles of railroad
in Oklahoma and Texas—confirms his belief that, in the absence of
actual figures of cost, right of way and other railroad real estate should
be appraised at but little in excess of the market value of abutting
property. The practice of the Texas Commission has been to add from
25 to 50 per cent. The conditions under which railroads were built
in Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Minnesota cannot have been radically
different from those in the Southern and Western States. In
Texas it has been a rare instance when a railroad has had to purchase
all of its right of way. Also, contiguous lands have greatly increased
in value since the advent of the railroads. It would appear highly
illogical to advocate that these increased values should be multiplied
by 3—or even 1½—and used as a basis for taxing the railroads on the
one hand, or taxing the public on the other, by permitting indebtedness
to be issued against it, the interest on which the latter must pay.
The railroad recently constructed by the writer traversed fertile and
thickly populated areas, already quite well served with transportation
facilities. Only a small fraction of the necessary real estate was
purchased by the railroad company, and only in a few cases of such
purchase did it pay largely in excess of the market value of the land—and
these were where the road interfered with houses and other farm
improvements. In cities and towns, land was acquired at practically
its fair market value. For rural property, the ratios used by Professor
Taylor in the Wisconsin appraisal appear to be quite fair, but in
cities they are too high—especially for the Southwest. The Minnesota
ratios appear to be unreasonably high.</p>

<p class='c000'>Any appraisal of the physical value of railroads—in the absence
of figures as to their actual cost—is necessarily only approximate, and
is correct only within certain limits. Especially with regard to the
old roads, where original cost data cannot be had, the values applied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>to property and construction must be largely speculative. It is impossible
to build two railroads in the same territory, on the same specifications,
for the same amount; yet, on the basis of cost of reproduction,
an appraisal board must apply the same value to each.</p>

<p class='c000'>The writer believes that unless there is more uniformity as to
methods of valuing corporation property, as between the States, all
valuations will be more or less discredited, as they should be, by the
Courts. It is to be hoped that this paper will be generally discussed
by the Profession, and will lead to the adoption of more uniform
methods.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Charles H. Ledlie, M. Am. Soc. C. E.</span> (by letter).—The following
is suggested as a method of procedure for determining the fair and
equitable value of a property:</p>

<p class='c000'>1st.—Examine carefully the statutes governing corporations of the
class under examination.</p>

<p class='c000'>2d.—Form an opinion as to whether or not the locality can support
such a property, by inquiry regarding the different businesses carried
on, bank clearings, railroad facilities, what the surrounding
country produces, etc.</p>

<p class='c000'>3d.—Find from the archives of the company a general description
of the property, from its conception to the date of appraisement.</p>

<p class='c000'>4th.—By close examination of the minute books, directors and
executive committees, there can be ascertained all the details of organization,
issuing of stock, bonds, and other forms of indebtedness, contracts
for equipment, supplies used in the construction, etc.</p>

<p class='c000'>5th.—Obtain from the general manager or the superintendents an
explanation of the details of operating and maintaining the property,
including the different classes of service, rates, etc.</p>

<p class='c000'>6th.—Go over the property, examine it carefully, and talk to any
and all employees from whom it is thought that any information
can be gained.</p>

<p class='c000'>The foregoing will give a general knowledge of the property under
examination, and will enable one to begin the real work. The
examiner's assistants must be competent and experienced men.</p>

<p class='c000'>7th.—Examine all the vouchers, from the beginning of the company
down to the date it began operation; classify their contents
under the respective heads for the different classes of material used
in the construction, for example, pipe, engines, cable, etc.; then prepare
blank tables for each heading, having columns for size, quantity,
prices, and total; and abstract each voucher. Do the same with the
vouchers for labor, general office salaries, general expenses, interest,
taxes, legal, etc. This, when completed, will give the detailed cost,
as shown by the vouchers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next check the vouchers back through the books, and draw up a
statement, which will show the total book cost and, no doubt, will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>differ from the voucher total. It is likely that many items will be
found for which no vouchers exist, a list of these is made and if the
officers cannot give a satisfactory explanation of any of them they
are omitted. The total of what remains is added to the voucher total
and represents the cash expended for the benefit of the original property,
as shown by the books and vouchers.</p>

<p class='c000'>8th.—Take all the remaining vouchers of the company (it is
supposed that the examiner has already been informed by the officers,
and by his inspection of the records, of the extensions and betterments
which have been made), separate the vouchers for materials,
labor, etc., from those on operating, etc. Next classify them by years,
and then proceed as set forth in 7th, and add the different yearly
amounts to the total of the original plant. This will show the amount
of cash expended (according to the vouchers and books) on the property,
for its physical plant, organization, etc., from its beginning to
the date of appraisement.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every examining engineer should know (or can obtain) the prices
for materials, labor, etc., during these periods of original construction,
extension, etc. If the prices are the same, or about the same, as
at the time of purchase, the above total stands as the cash expended;
if there should be much difference—and sometimes there is—take the
detail of the materials as found in the vouchers, affix the proper prices,
and do the same with labor, etc., and this total will be what, in the
judgment of the examining engineer, the plant should have cost. A
mean between this latter total and that in 8th is taken, in order
to be fair and equitable. This amount, in place of that given by 8th,
is then used as the cash expended on the physical property. If no
difference is found in prices, then the total cash as shown by 8th is
considered as the total to be hereafter used.</p>

<p class='c000'>9th.—A careful detailed inventory is now made of the physical
property as it exists at the date of examination. This often requires
some excavation in order to determine sizes, quantities, and conditions.
The prices used to ascertain the total of the inventory are
made by taking the average of all those paid for materials, labor,
etc., of the same class, during each year of the property's existence.
(The writer considers it manifestly unfair to use the current prices
in this calculation, for they may be very much below or above those
actually paid, and in either event an injustice would be done, whereas,
if the average prices are used, the examiner cannot be accused of unfairness.)
To this total cost, as shown by the inventory, 5% is added
for engineering and superintendence; 3% for general office salaries,
2% for general expenses, 1½% for legal and organization expenses,
and from 5 to 10% for contingencies. (This latter percentage depends
on the judgment of the examiner, who, after studying the local
conditions carefully, can determine from his own experience what difficulties
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>have been met in the construction. It is not believed that
a hard-and-fast rule can, in equity, be laid down for this latter
percentage.) This total represents the value of the tangible property,
based on the inventory. The inventory cost and that set forth in 8th
(or possibly as modified by prices current when the plant was built)
are averaged, and this result, plus the supplies on hand, is the fair and
equitable amount of cash which has been expended on the property.
This is used in finding the "Fair and Equitable Value."</p>

<p class='c000'>10th.—Next take the inventory of the plant set forth in 9th, affix
the current prices at the date of appraisal, and to this total add the
same percentages for engineering, etc., as set forth in 9th. This gives
the cost of reproducing the property, with the same classes of materials,
size and make of engines, etc., as is now in it, to which total
add the cost of materials on hand for the total of cash required to
be expended at current prices to reproduce the plant as it exists.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is often found that this latter total is greater than that set
forth in 8th, for the reason that the engines, etc., may be of types which
are now abandoned or obsolete, and the manufacturing company,
having to make patterns, etc., would charge more for them than the
original price at the date of purchase.</p>

<p class='c000'>This reproduction cost at current prices is only to give the examiner
information he may or may not require later in the investigation to
determine some point that might arise in ascertaining the "Fair
and Equitable Value."</p>

<p class='c000'>The writer considers it unfair to call the reproduction value the
cost of a modern plant which will give the same service and output,
because one is not dealing with the value of a modern plant, but with
that of an existing property.</p>

<p class='c000'>11th.—From this cost (using the detailed inventory to find the
extent of property still in existence), calculate the amount of depreciation
for each section of the plant, this being based on the present
condition of the different parts and what their future life may be.
The total depreciation is then deducted from the result found in 9th,
and this remainder is used as the "Fair and Equitable Value" of the
tangible property at the date of appraisal.</p>

<p class='c000'>The intangible value (called by many names) must now be determined.
It consists of rights, from the State, county, city, or any
one or more combined, which the company must have in order to
carry on its business. These rights in nearly all States are taxable,
and taxes are collected on them. The Supreme Court of the United
States has in the past held that they are property, notwithstanding
what State "Courts and Commissions" have set forth on this subject,
and in the writer's examinations they will be treated as property
until the Supreme Court of the United States decides otherwise.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>There are in general three classes of franchises, namely:</p>

<p class='c018'>I.—Those granted by the State to conduct a business, where
no county or city franchise is necessary, only requiring the
company to obey the ordinances for excavation, etc. The
charter of the Laclede Gas Company, of St. Louis, Mo., is
an example of this class.</p>

<p class='c018'>II.—Those granted by the State to carry on a business subject
to a county or city franchise.</p>

<p class='c018'>III.—Those granted by a city to an individual, singular or plural,
or a company, to do business within its limits or a section
thereof.</p>

<p class='c000'>In each case the right may be a contract, for it may require a
payment for the franchise granted, either in a lump sum or in yearly
installments, or in the form of services rendered, such as for light,
etc., free service of some kind, or a combination of any two or all
of them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The manner of determining the value of "Intangible Property" is
as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>a</em>) The gross collected earnings are audited for each year during
the period the company has carried on its business. The same is done
for all vouchers, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span></i>, operating, maintenance, salaries, legal, general
expenses, interest, insurance, and taxes, and includes every item disbursed.
Whatever this latter amounts to, is deducted from each year's
gross earnings as already found, and the result is the true net earnings
or deficit for each year.</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>b</em>) The true net earnings are added together and the mean taken;
if, in the period from the beginning to the date of appraisement, any
deficits are found, these are deducted from the total of the plus-earnings,
the result is divided by the total number of years, and this
gives the true average net earnings. This is then capitalized at the
legal rate of interest of the State in which the property is located.
The result is used as the value of the "Intangible Property."</p>

<p class='c000'>12th.—The amount given by 11th is added to the result obtained
by 9th, and this total is the "Tangible and Intangible Value" of the
property, and the "Fair and Equitable Value" of the property at
date of appraisement.</p>

<p class='c000'>If it is found that grave mistakes in design or judgment have
been made by not employing competent people, and money has been
wasted in construction, the plant is re-designed, for the original plant,
and its cost estimated. The same is done for each extension, using
the prices paid at the different periods, and this result is used in
place of 9th, as the cash cost at the date of appraisement.</p>

<p class='c000'>In determining the intangible value, if it is found that the management
has been careless in order to make large net earnings, at the
expense of the physical property, estimates are made of what the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>property can be operated and cared for (here the practical knowledge
of operation, etc., is necessary), and these results, plus taxes, etc.,
are subtracted from each year's collected earnings.  The mean or
average of these results is considered as the true net earnings, which
are capitalized and added as set forth in 12th.</p>

<p class='c000'>The writer holds that consumers or purchasers should not pay
for avoidable error or ignorance, and the amount of the securities
issued on the property is not considered as entering into the matter
of "Fair and Equitable Value"; when they do, the method is somewhat
different.</p>

<p class='c000'>The mean true net earnings are used in determining the intangible
value, because franchises have average values, as earnings and
expenses fluctuate in corporations, and, when intangible values are to
be considered, they must not be based on the last year's net earnings,
for if they are, they may give a very large result in one year and a
small one in the next; therefore, to be fair, the mean true net earnings
should be the basis of the intangible value. If the company has
been over-capitalized, and no sinking fund or depreciation has been
set aside, it is the present owner's misfortune. If the company calls
something a betterment, and it is found that the betterment has
only replaced something, it is not allowed, but is classed as maintenance;
on the other hand, if the replacement is larger, and capable
of rendering greater results, such as a larger engine, pipe, cable, etc.,
the cost, less the cost of what it replaces, is allowed as a betterment,
and if the old part is sold the proceeds are deducted from the betterment
charge, for if it is credited to maintenance, it increases the
true net earnings. This is often done, but is not the correct way
to treat the matter, for it increases the intangible value.</p>

<p class='c000'>13th.—When new rates are to be established for a period of future
years, the manner of determining the "Fair and Equitable Value"
is the same as has been heretofore set forth. The new rates are based
on averages, and the first step necessary is to ascertain what gross
revenue the company must have in order to pay all classes of operating
expenses, maintenance, depreciation, taxes, interest on the "Fair
and Equitable Value" of the property, and a reasonable profit.</p>

<p class='c000'>To obtain this amount, the procedure is as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>a</em>) Find the percentage of increase of the operating expenses
for each year over the prior one, for a period of generally five years
preceding the date of examination (a longer time may be taken if,
in the opinion of the examiner, it is necessary), and then ascertain
the average annual increase of the percentages. The result thus
obtained is taken as the increase percentage for the operating expenses
for the new period of time.</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>b</em>) In order to determine what the operating expenses will average
during the time the new contract is to run, take the amount of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>last year's operating expenses as a basis and add to it the percentage
found by (<em>a</em>). This total is the operating cost for the first year of
the new contract. The amount for the second year is found by
adding to the cost of the first year the percentage found by (<em>a</em>), and
so on for each year of the new period. These results are added together
and their average is then used as the mean cost of operation
for each year during the full period.</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>c</em>) The same method is followed for maintenance and taxes, in
order to find the average maintenance and taxes for the new contract's
life.</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>d</em>) Depreciation on the plant begins from the date of appraisement,
and is estimated on the physical property by using for each
section the percentages used in determining the "Fair and Equitable
Value."</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>e</em>) Interest at the rate of 6% is allowed on the "Fair and Equitable
Value," and 6% profit.</p>

<p class='c000'>The question of extensions and betterments to the original plant
must now be taken into consideration.</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>f</em>) The amount of the betterments and extensions have already
been found for each year of the property's existence, and an average
of them is taken as the amount the company will spend on extensions,
etc., during each year of the new contract. On this sum 6%
interest and 6% profit is allowed, and, for depreciation, the same
percentage as used in the original plant.</p>

<p class='c000'>It will be seen that all the expenses of operation, etc., of these
extensions have been allowed in (<em>b</em>), where the increase has been
added for each year for these extensions and betterments, as they are
assumed to increase the cost of operation, etc.</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>g</em>) The amounts found by (<em>b</em>), (<em>c</em>), (<em>d</em>), (<em>e</em>), and (<em>f</em>) are now
added together, and to the sum 5% is added for interest, taxes, operation,
etc., which may be caused by the necessary increase in capital
expenditures, for a greater growth than could be foreseen at the time
the new rates were established, for losses, etc. This total is used as
the basis for establishing the new schedule of rates.</p>

<p class='c000'>14th.—The next step is to determine what part of the amount
found by (<em>g</em>) must be paid by the different classes of consumers.</p>

<p class='c000'>(I) First ascertain the yearly percentage of increase in the output
of the plant for the five years before the new contract is to go
into effect (or longer if, in the opinion of the examiner, it is necessary);
then find the average increase of percentage during the before-mentioned
five years. Add to the last year's output the percentage
found above, this result representing the output for the first year of
the new contract. Continue this operation for each year in the
same way as the operating expenses were found in 13th (<em>b</em>). The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>average of these results will be the average estimated output during
the life of the new contract.</p>

<p class='c000'>(II) Next find the amount of the total output each class of consumers
used during each of the five years, and then find the average
yearly use during this period. Put these into percentages of the
amount of the average output for the five years, and then use the
percentages as the amount each class of consumer will use of the
average output found in (I) during the period of the new contract.</p>

<p class='c000'>This gives the average amount of the output each class of consumers
will use during the average life of the new contract.</p>

<p class='c000'>(III) Next find the average percentage of the total revenue each
class of customers paid during the five years. Take these percentages
as the average percentage each class will pay of the average revenue
necessary during the time the new contract is to run.</p>

<p class='c000'>(IV) Having found the average amount of the required revenue
that each class must pay, and the average amount of the total output
each class will use, dividing the former by the latter for each
case will give the rate each class is to pay during the new period.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is often found in plants that large extensions have been made
to supply a special contract for a long period of time, and these extensions
are set aside for the exclusive use of this contract. In such
cases exclude the cost, etc., of this part of the plant from the "Fair
and Equitable Value" in the matter of adjustment of rates.</p>

<p class='c000'>In determining the operating expenses, etc., in such a case, find
the percentage of the total output this special output amounts to; then,
using this percentage, find what part of the total power-house expenses
of all kinds are caused by this special contract. This result is deducted
from the total power-house expense, and the remainder is the power-house
cost of furnishing the consumers with their share of the total
output. If it is found that special employees are required to deliver
this special output, their cost is deducted, and the same for the maintenance
material used. Taxes and interest on the cost of this special
equipment are found by ascertaining the percentage this cost of the
special equipment bears to the whole plant.</p>

<p class='c000'>The above results are deducted from the total operating, maintenance,
taxes, and interest disbursements, and "Fair and Equitable
Value," and the remainders are used as the cost of the last year's
expenses for furnishing the consumers with their share of the product
and the "Fair and Equitable Value."</p>

<p class='c000'>The same method is used in determining the revenue paid by
the consumer.</p>

<p class='c000'>The above result, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span></i>, cost of operating, etc., is then used as the
basis for estimating the expenses for the period of the new contract,
as heretofore set forth.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the charter comes under Class II or III, the city no doubt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>has incorporated a clause for the adjustment of rates, and the method
used above is followed.</p>

<p class='c000'>15th.—Where the franchise has expired and is going to be renewed,
the same method holds.</p>

<p class='c000'>16th.—Where the franchise has expired and the city has paid
a certain amount for service, and is to buy the property, the same
method is used, except in determining the intangible value. For
determining the latter, the amount the city pays for service is deducted
from the gross collected revenue. From expenses is deducted the
same percentage as the amount of the city's payment is of the gross
revenue; a net revenue is found from this, the taxes paid are deducted,
the remainder is capitalized as heretofore set forth, and is
the intangible value. Whatever the latter amounts to is added to
(or deducted from, in case of deficit) the "Fair and Equitable Physical
Value," and the result is the price the city should pay.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cities generally claim, and so do their "experts," that they should
only pay junk value, or the cost of a modern plant to give the same
results. This is eminently unfair, because the city buys a property
which is in full operation and it receives the full revenue, in addition
to obtaining service for itself at a less cost than it heretofore
paid. The difference between the cost to the city of furnishing the
service itself, and what it paid the company, is profit, but there is a
charge against this of loss in taxes. These two latter items, namely,
profit and taxes, generally balance each other, although the writer has
known of cases where the city was the gainer.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are many points which can be advanced to establish the
fairness of the methods outlined herein, but they would take some
time to explain, and therefore the writer has only set out the plan he
follows in his examinations, hoping that it may be of some aid in
establishing a uniform method which will be upheld by the Courts.</p>

<p class='c000'>It may be stated that recently this method was used in an examination,
going back thirty-five years, and the results were accepted by
both sides without question.</p>

<p class='c000'>The writer has refused a number of examinations when told in
advance what result must be found, as well as in "expert" work,
where the examiner is expected to help make a case, regardless of his
honest judgment, for, by accepting such work, the engineer hurts
his reputation and lays the Profession open to such remarks as Judge
Lacombe recently made in the case of the Peoria Water-Works Company
<em>vs.</em> Central Railway Company.</p>

<p class='c000'>The writer is fast coming to the conclusion that a great deal of
legal trouble is caused by the decisions of commissions, the members
of which have not had experience in these matters. If a commission
consisted of an able lawyer, a financial man, and an engineer who
has had a broad operating experience, its decisions would carry weight,
and the Courts would not be burdened with so many appeals.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span><span class='sc'>William G. Raymond, M. Am. Soc. C. E.</span> (by letter).—This is,
perhaps, the best paper on the valuation of public service property
that has yet appeared. The author's analysis is very clear, and his
arguments are convincing.  Three points the writer would like to
consider; two of them briefly.</p>

<p class='c000'>The item, "going value," even if it is determined on logical reasoning,
as suggested by Professor Mead, would seem to be a dangerous
item, and one which might result in absurdities when estimated by
an unscrupulous, ignorant person. Moreover, the term has been
differently defined, and there is no certainty as to just what it means.
The writer sees no reason for the existence of such a term, or of such
a separate quantity as this term is supposed to represent.</p>

<p class='c000'>The term, "franchise value," or, "value of the franchise," is used
to represent the difference between the capitalized net earnings and
the value of the physical property. Of course, there is such a difference,
either positive or negative, but there seems to be some objection
by the Courts to calling this "franchise value." The writer, therefore,
would suggest that, since franchise value is a very elusive item, depending
on the life of the franchise, the attitude of the community toward
the corporation, the activity of competing corporations, and numerous
indeterminate items, the term, "business value," or, "going concern
value," be used instead of "franchise value." "Going concern value"
is not as good a term as "business value" or "value of the business,"
because it may be assumed to include both the value of the business
and the value of the property. "Value of the business" would presumably
include the value of the franchise, and perhaps would not
always be represented exactly by the difference between the capitalized
net earnings and the value of the physical property, but would be this
difference affected by some judgment percentage resulting from a consideration
of the probable continuance of the franchise.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Riggs has truly said that the value of the physical property
must not be made to depend on the purpose for which the valuation
is made; that, for the business for which it is used, the value of the
physical property is the same, regardless of the purpose for which a
valuation is desired; but valuations are made for different purposes,
and, while there is room for argument as to the proper valuation to
be used for capitalization, taxation, or sale, there are perfectly definite
methods suggested for valuing property for these purposes. The
writer has never seen a statement—that appealed to him as at all
rational—of a proper method of valuing property for rate-making.
Indeed, the writer has said<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c003'><sup>[32]</sup></a> that "proper traffic rates have no relation
to valuation except that the minimum net income should be at least
sufficient to pay interest on the physical valuation." The writer is
not absolutely certain of the correctness of this position, for a study
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>of the public right to regulate a corporation which is performing a
semi-public function seems to indicate that the public has a right to
say, not only that rates shall be non-discriminatory, but also that they
shall be reasonable.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now, the writer is familiar with three bases for the determination
of what constitutes reasonableness of rates. One, which applies to
rates as a whole, is this: That the net income should produce not
more than a reasonable interest rate on the actually invested capital.
Another is the rate that the traffic will bear, and the third is a rate
that represents what the service is worth to the purchaser. Of course,
a difficulty arises in determining reasonable rates on any one of these
three bases.</p>

<p class='c000'>The only difficulty with the first one is in determining what is
a reasonable interest rate on invested capital, and, as far as the writer
has read, no Court has yet determined what this is, although some
Courts have held that 5% is a not unreasonable return, that 8% is
a not unreasonable return, and, if the writer's memory serves him
right, that even 15% is a not unreasonable return.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is great difficulty in the determination of what the traffic
will bear. It is a matter of the exercise of judgment and of experiment,
and must be applied to a considerable extent to particular rates,
for particular commodities, for particular places.</p>

<p class='c000'>The third basis would seem to be the most difficult to use, although
it is one which has recently been established in important Court
decisions, and is mentioned by Mr. Riggs. What is a monopoly-provided
service worth to the user or purchaser? Suppose that a gas
company charges $1.60 per 1,000 cu. ft. for gas, and a very considerable
part of the populace living in the city served purchases gas at
this price. Presumably the purchasers pay what the service is worth
to them, and what they are willing to pay rather than suffer the
inconvenience of tallow candles, oil lamps, or to pay a high price for
electric lights. Suppose that through a period of five years, by a
series of reductions voluntarily made, the price of gas finally reaches
$1.15 per 1,000 cu. ft. Is this gas worth any less to the consumer at
the end of the five-year period than it was at the beginning? So far
as the writer can see, it is, for only one reason, namely, that it can
be had for less; but this has been a voluntary reduction on the part
of the supply corporation, and who shall say that the service is not
worth less than $1.15 to the consumer, or who shall say that it was
not worth less than $1.60 at the beginning of the period suggested?
The figures here given represent an actual case which has occurred
during the last five years, within the writer's knowledge. There seems
to be a growing feeling among the people that rates as a whole must
be fixed so as to yield only a reasonable return to the corporation, and,
apparently only for want of the suggestion of a better method, a reasonable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>return has been held to mean a reasonable return on the capital
invested. Believing that there may be some ground for the claim that
rates as a whole should be thus fixed, and that the return should not
be unreasonable, let us consider how what is reasonable may be
determined.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the first place, it appeals to the writer that the invested capital
is not the proper basis for estimating reasonable rates. If it shall be
finally established that a corporation is entitled to realize only a
reasonable interest rate on the capital invested, there will be no more
public service corporations organized; but, if the reasonableness of the
return may be based on the capital invested and the business done,
there will still be good inducement to capable men to engage in public
service business.</p>

<p class='c000'>It would seem that the rate of return that is reasonable differs for
the capital invested and for the business done—that is to say, if the
capital invested is $1,000,000, an ordinary investment return of from
4 to 5% may be sufficient; and if the business done with this million-dollar
plant amounts to $10,000,000 a year, a reasonable return may
be 10% or even 15% of the whole.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now, as has been suggested by Mr. Riggs, it is manifestly impossible
to capitalize the net earnings as a basis for determining
reasonable rates, because these net earnings are the result of certain
rates already established, the reasonableness of which may be in
question; and if, instead of speaking separately of interest rate on
capital actually invested and profit rate on business done, it is desired
to obtain a value on which to base reasonable rates, the following is
suggested as a method: Determine the physical value and the annual
interest on this physical value at an assumed reasonable rate, say 5%;
determine the annual expense of conducting the business, and assume
a business man's profit rate, say 15%, and find the profit that should
be earned on the business done. This, added to the total interest
charge, should give the net income, over and above operating expenses,
that may be considered reasonable, and this sum, capitalized at any
given assumed reasonable interest rate, would give a value which
might with reason be used as a basis for rate-making, rates being
deemed to be reasonable as a whole which furnish from year to year
a simple reasonable interest rate on this established value. Of course,
there is no necessity for establishing such a value, as the reasonableness
of the rates will be determined when it is learned that they
produce not more than a fair interest rate on the actual physical value
of the property plus a fair profit rate on the business done.</p>

<p class='c000'>This method is not free from the objection that what is a reasonable
interest rate and what is a reasonable profit rate have never yet
been fixed, but it is much easier to fix these separately than to fix what
is a reasonable return on the capital actually invested or the physical
valuation of the property.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span><span class='sc'>W. H. Williams, Esq.</span> (by letter).—Before entering upon the discussion
of the more essential elements of the problem presented by
this paper, it seems worth while to correct one or two misapprehensions
under which Mr. Riggs seems to labor, and to call attention to the
rather extraordinary temper in which he approaches the grave questions
with which he deals.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Riggs' first serious misapprehension is that railway officers, as
a class, are, with substantial unanimity, opposed to any official valuation
of railway properties, and that this opposition was voiced through
the writer's discussion of Professor Henry C. Adams' paper in favor
of valuation, at the last annual (December, 1909) meeting of the
American Economic Association. Of course, on that occasion, the
writer spoke, as he now speaks, only for himself, but, more than that,
he then expressly disclaimed any such opposition, undertook to make
suggestions as to the manner in which a proper valuation could be
obtained, and directed his criticisms plainly at a proposal which contemplated,
as he then observed:</p>

<p class='c018'>"An incomplete and misleading valuation bearing the stamp and
carrying the weight of governmental sanction, which can be of no
practical advantage to the Government, the public, or the railways;
but may easily injure the public and the railways by disturbing the
confidence of the former and hampering the activities of the latter."</p>

<p class='c000'>The writer then added:</p>

<p class='c018'>"It seems very clear that such a valuation as is proposed would
be wholly useless to the Government for any practical purpose, because
it would omit so many factors essential to any fair appraisement of the
worth of the enterprises as going concerns."</p>

<p class='c000'>Bearing in mind that the foregoing was addressed to the particular
proposal made by Professor Adams, that being the topic on which the
writer was invited to speak, a proposal expressly limited to the ascertainment
of cost of reproduction less depreciation (the equivalent of
cost of replacement with second-hand materials in a condition equivalent
to that of the materials in use and hereinafter referred to as
"cost of replacement") under the pseudonym of "physical value" (or
sometimes "inventory value"), it would seem as though Mr. Riggs
should sympathize with the writer's view, rather than with that of
Professor Adams. Certainly, Mr. Riggs is fully aware of the inadequacy
of mere cost of replacement to serve any useful purpose, for,
after saying that:</p>

<p class='c018'>"No account may be taken of the purpose for which the resultant
figure of value is to be used; and the result should not vary, no matter
what the purpose may be."</p>

<p class='c000'>He says, in another place:</p>

<p class='c018'>"* * * it is clear that the worth of the physical property,
being the cost of reproduction less depreciation, is not necessarily the
value of the property. * * *"</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>And, defining what he calls the "non-physical or intangible elements
of value," says:</p>

<p class='c018'>"These are those things which, added to or taken from the worth
of the physical property, make up the value, and include whatever
accrues to the property by reason of its operation, or by reason of
grants, contract rights, competition, or location, which at the time of
appraisal affect favorably or unfavorably the worth of the property."</p>

<p class='c000'>The second misapprehension that is worthy of notice seems to have
grown out of a curious sensitiveness, on the part of Mr. Riggs, as to
any suggestion, other than his own, of criticism of any work undertaken
or theories advanced by Professor Adams. As to every reader,
other than Mr. Riggs, it is surely quite unnecessary to say that no
attack has been made upon Professor Adams by the writer at the New
York meeting of the American Economic Association or anywhere
else. Certainly, it will be conceded that some difficulty would attend
an effort to respond to an invitation to discuss before a scientific body
a paper written by one of its members without making any allusion to
the author of the paper or to his views or work, and those who have
any knowledge of the history of official railway valuations in the
United States, and especially of the proposal to undertake a Federal
investigation of cost of replacement, are fully aware that Professor
Adams has been from the beginning, and now is, the Hamlet of the
drama, without whom it would become dull and lifeless. Strangely
enough, Mr. Riggs seems to wish to deny to Professor Adams this
prominence, for he says:</p>

<p class='c018'>"Professor Adams was associated with the Michigan appraisal, but
had no connection whatever with the 'physical valuation,' to which
such objection is taken, and his appointment was made after the work
of physical valuation had been fully outlined and was well under way."</p>

<p class='c000'>It is true that the scheme devised by Professor Adams, and adopted
at his suggestion by Governor Pingree, required the employment of
civil engineers for the preliminary work which necessarily had to
precede the final "valuation" by Professor Adams, but the bare statement
of this fact is utterly misleading. Professor Adams' own testimony
in one of the Michigan tax cases happily places his responsibility
for the whole plan entirely beyond controversy. He said:</p>

<p class='c018'>"In 1900 I was called upon by the Michigan State Tax Commission
to determine whether railroads were paying a tax rate on their value
equal to the rate on other property. With that problem in view, I
formulated this inventory plan. * * *"<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c003'><sup>[33]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Any discussion of the proposal for a National inquiry concerning
cost of replacement which omits to show that its most persistent
advocate, Professor Adams, has advocated and actually conducted or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>controlled several successive "valuations," in Michigan, as Statistician
to the Interstate Commerce Commission, and as special employee of
the Bureau of the Census, made in accordance with other methods than
those which he now proposes to apply, is seriously inadequate; as
seriously inadequate as it would be to omit to state that, using what
purported to be the same method, Professor Adams, by changing the
details of its application and decreasing the rates of interest used in his
computations, raised his "valuation" of Michigan railways from
$152,958,202 to $177,689,292 or 16.17%, each of the two calculations
being presented to the public, with assurances that it disclosed the
actual taxable value, and there being barely eighteen months between
them. The writer is by no means alone as an object of Mr. Riggs' dissatisfaction
because of public criticisms of Professor Adams' plan for
estimating cost of replacement. Thus, of a statement in which
Professor Taylor, who conducted the Wisconsin inquiry, questioned
the validity of some of Professor Adams' methods, he writes:</p>

<p class='c018'>"Undoubtedly this statement was made in good faith, and has
gained currency by not having been corrected, but it is not the fact."</p>

<p class='c000'>In another place, referring to a statement of comparative costs to
the respective States for valuation work, made by the Railroad Commission
of the State of Washington, he says:</p>

<p class='c018'>"It does not appear to be good taste either to criticize costs of work
in other States, or compare the costs in Wisconsin and Michigan with
the cost in Washington."</p>

<p class='c000'>Referring to a paper by Charles Hansel, M. Am. Soc. C. E., who
took part in the Michigan valuation, Mr. Riggs says:</p>

<p class='c018'>"The one point to which special attention is drawn is Mr. Hansel's
astonishing misconception of Professor Adams' plan of work. This
misleading statement appears in the first paper and is reiterated in the
second."</p>

<p class='c000'>Again, of the report of the expert of the Washington Railroad Commission,
who had the temerity to declare that it found "little value"
either in Professor Adams' methods or his estimates of the cost of the
work, Mr. Riggs says:</p>

<p class='c018'>"Such sentences, and others which, by inference if not by name,
reflect on work executed by men of high professional standing, are
hardly in good taste, even if true, in a report to a railroad commission
of another State."</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet Mr. Riggs does not fail to criticize the method of "valuation,"
applied by Professor Adams in Michigan, in terms quite as definite as
any used by others.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus, he condemns the method used to estimate the value of the
non-physical elements appertaining to the Michigan railways, on the
grounds (first) that it made this value a mere derivative of the rates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>existing, and (second) that it made no allowance for negative values
when cost of replacement exceeded real value, saying:</p>

<p class='c018'>"It will be seen that, in the case of a property in which the surplus
earnings depend on excessive rates for service, it will fail as a method
of determining a value for use as a basis of rate-making; and it fails,
in the form in which it was used in 1900 and 1902, to bring out those
negative or subtractive elements which may be determined from the
income accounts, in the case of properties which do not earn a fair
return on the investment."</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the published statistics of American railways, compiled in the
office of which Professor Adams is the responsible head, derived from
annual reports made in accordance with forms prescribed by the Interstate
Commerce Commission under his guidance, and containing items
selected from and depending on the uniform railway accounting system
devised by Professor Adams and imposed on the carriers by the Commission,
Mr. Riggs writes:</p>

<p class='c018'>"The published statistics are in such form that only the careful
student of affairs can understand or analyze them, and but few of the
public officials who receive them are able to read the reports of the
properties and comprehend them."</p>

<p class='c000'>Railway officers fall quite generally under Mr. Riggs' condemnation,
for, of them he says:</p>

<p class='c018'>"As a body * * * it is doubtful if any equal number of men,
of equal intelligence, have as limited a knowledge of the fundamental
truths of government, or knowledge so colored by bias. It is also doubtful
whether any equal number of men have in their ranks so few who
bear an active part in the duties and activities of citizenship, or who
exercise large influence on their neighbors."</p>

<p class='c000'>Such assertions as the foregoing need no comment; their intemperance
is their most effective refutation; yet a few recent examples may
be cited: Paul Morton resigned as Vice-President of the Atchison,
Topeka and Santa Fe to become Secretary of the Navy in Mr. Roosevelt's
cabinet; Jacob M. Dickinson, General Solicitor of the Illinois
Central, became Mr. Taft's Secretary of War; his successor with the
Illinois Central, William S. Kenyon, later became Special Assistant
of the Attorney-General; Lloyd W. Bowers, General Solicitor of the
Chicago and Northwestern, was Solicitor-General of the United States
from early in Mr. Taft's administration until his death a few months
ago. Thus, within but four or five years, the Federal Government
took four of its highest officers from the railway officers located in
only one of the country's great cities—Chicago.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of a recent address by one of the ablest and most public-spirited
of railway officers, he says:</p>

<p class='c018'>"This address well expresses the spirit of the railway managers and
employees toward all forms of investigation, and the complete lack of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>understanding, on the part of these managers, of the legal and moral
relations which they bear to the communities which they serve."</p>

<p class='c000'>Belonging to this so hateful class, and having also ventured to
question whether Professor Adams has said the last and most perfect
word on the subject of railway valuation, the writer is neither surprised
nor disheartened to find that he, also, has caused Mr. Riggs
undisguised dissatisfaction. It is a misfortune apparently inseparable
from his profession and his conception of his obligations to his
employers and to the public.</p>

<p class='c000'>As has been already noted herein, the question is not whether
railway property shall be officially "valued," but rather (first) as to
how the "value" which is to be ascertained is properly to be defined,
and (second) how the determination of "value," as properly defined,
can be made most accurate.</p>

<p class='c000'>The essential difference between the view advocated before the
American Economic Association by Professor Adams and that of the
writer was, and is, that the former now desires to exclude all elements
of value which are not physical and tangible, while the writer holds
that, if it is worth while to ascertain, on a general scale, at the cost
of a necessarily large expenditure of taxpayers' money, and as to a
particular date, so unstable a fact as railway value, the kind of value
the ascertainment of which could be of sufficient utility to warrant the
effort can be nothing less significant than the "fair value" which the
Courts have said is a proper element for consideration in fixing
reasonable rates of charge. The fundamental difference between these
two conceptions of value is admirably indicated by the following quotations,
both of which rest on the authority of the Interstate Commerce
Commission.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><span class='sc'>Fair Value.</span></h3>

<p class='c014'>"The present value of a railroad
property is necessarily very
largely a matter of opinion only;
it depends upon a vast number
of contingencies and uncertainties,
a road apparently of great
value to-day may soon become
worthless by the opening of a
competing line having superior
advantages or by the competitive
struggles of other lines which
operate to reduce the income of
all; the value of a railroad largely
results from the personal characteristics
of its officials; the
policy pursued by directors for
the conservative and economical
or progressive and daring, is a
great factor in the determination
of the current value of the property;
a railroad property is not
necessarily worth what it would
cost to replace it and, on the other
hand, it may be worth very much
more than that."<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c003'><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c013'><span class='sc'>Replacement Cost.</span></h3>

<p class='c014'>"The bill in question makes
use of the phrase 'fair value.'
Unless there is some legislative
necessity, which we do not perceive,
we question the advisability
of using this phrase.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It would seem to us preferable
to substitute a phrase which
indicates the fact that Congress
desires an inventory valuation of
railway property. By inventory
valuation is meant that the property
of the several railways shall
be listed in detail, and that each
kind or class of property so listed
shall have assigned to it a valuation
to be determined from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>point of view of the contracting
engineer, and not from the point
of view of a court or board of arbitration
which, from the nature of
the case, cannot judge of what is
'fair value' except in the light of
some specific use to be made of
the valuation."<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c003'><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>As has already been noted herein, and amply verified by quotations,
Mr. Riggs is fully aware that replacement cost and real value
can rarely, if ever, coincide, and therefore plainly agrees, as to that
elementary and essential point, with the writer and disagrees with
Professor Adams, who would ignore or destroy every non-physical
element of value in the property of all public service corporations.
Mr. Riggs' recognition of the inadequacy of mere replacement cost is
shown also by the excellent and convincing example which he cites<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c003'><sup>[36]</sup></a>
of competitive railway routes between two Michigan cities which were
built and are maintained and operated under such conditions that the
far more costly of the two, which inferentially has correspondingly
higher replacement cost, has much lower earning capacity, both as to
gross and net, and is therefore actually worth much less than its less
costly competitor. Mr. Riggs explicitly favors full recognition of the
non-physical elements in every valuation; and, therefore, may be
ranked as an opponent of any such scheme of valuation as that
advocated by Professor Adams before the American Economic Association,
or in the letter of the Chairman of the Interstate Commerce
Commission, hereinbefore quoted.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Riggs, however, believes that the determination of the cost of
replacement is an essential first step toward the ascertainment of real
value. He says:</p>

<p class='c018'>"The worth of the physical property is primarily that on which the
value of the whole property rests."</p>

<p class='c000'>The thought which the writer would place in opposition to the foregoing
is that: Physical property has no value which is not an expression
of its adaptation to economic needs. This is only another way of expressing
the inevitable economic law, from which there is no escape, either
in theory or in practice, that has been stated and sanctioned by the
Supreme Court of the United States, as follows:</p>

<p class='c018'>"But the value of property results from the use to which it is put,
and varies with the profitableness of that use, present and prospective,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>actual and anticipated. There is no pecuniary value outside of that
which results from such use."<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c003'><sup>[37]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Riggs' own definition of value is not inconsistent with the
foregoing. He says:</p>

<p class='c018'>"The value of a property is its estimated worth at a given time,
measured in money, taking into account all the elements which add to
its usefulness or desirability as a business or profit-earning proposition."</p>

<p class='c000'>The view of Mr. Riggs is that:</p>

<p class='c018'>"While ... the worth of the physical property, being the
cost of reproduction less depreciation, is not necessarily the value
of the property, ... the physical worth must bear some very
definite relation to value...."</p>

<p class='c000'>And he is, further:</p>

<p class='c018'>"Strongly of the conviction that this relation is such that 'value'
cannot be ascertained without a determination of physical worth."</p>

<p class='c000'>It is exceedingly difficult to comprehend just what Mr. Riggs means
when he describes the relation between real value (which he recognizes
so clearly as value in use) and cost of replacement as "very definite."
Certainly, he does not mean that it is a constant relation, or one which
can be ascertained until there has been independent determination of
both of the aggregates whose relation it expresses. In fact, the
emphasis which Mr. Riggs places on replacement cost has led him into
the grotesque fallacy of arguing that a correct estimate of real value
is only to be attained by ascertaining: (first) cost of replacement,
(second) real value, and (third) correcting the aggregate first obtained
by applying whatever "very definite" relation (ratio) is necessary to
make it agree with the second aggregate, which was from the beginning
the only aggregate really wanted. The accuracy of this characterization
of his proposed procedure is made perfectly clear by the following
quotation:</p>

<p class='c018'>"... the true method of valuing a corporate property is first
to determine the cost of reproduction of the property and its depreciation,
and modify this figure by any applicable positive or negative non-physical
elements of value."</p>

<p class='c000'>It is submitted that the clear meaning of the foregoing is that
both replacement cost and real value as derived from use must be
separately and independently ascertained, and that, these aggregates
having been compared, the former is to be corrected by whatever
allowance for non-physical value may be required to make it agree
precisely with the latter. The obvious suggestion flowing from this
discovery of his theory is that only value in use is wanted, as that is
the only real value, and as it must be separately ascertained in any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>event, no other and <em>pseudo</em> value need be taken. The essential character
of the method is as described, even when it is applied through
determination of the annual value of the use and the assignment of
one portion of such annual value to return on the capital value of the
physical property and another portion to return on the capital value
of non-physical property. The real nature of the method is not even
effectually concealed by the capitalization of the income assigned to
physical property at one rate and the income assigned to non-physical
property at a different and higher rate. In fact, if it is necessary to
conclude that a portion of the net annual income of railway property
is normally paid to, or in respect of, a portion of capital entitled to a
lower rate of return, and the remainder to or in respect of a remainder
of capital entitled to a higher rate, the appraisal of the physical property
is an excessively costly, cumbersome, and inaccurate expedient for
determining the amount or value of either portion of the capital. Yet
that is exactly what was done in Michigan by Professor Adams, the
"valuation" he then made being completed before he altered his view
by deciding that the non-physical elements of value are entitled to no
consideration whatever, and that only cost of replacement is worthy
of inclusion in an official "valuation."</p>

<p class='c000'>But is there any real distinction between the "physical properties"
and the "immaterial elements," such as the foregoing extract seems
to assume? Is not the superficial appearance of such a distinction
plausible but deceptive? A locomotive is an entity; so is a railway.
The separate parts of a locomotive are most of them independently
valuable; so are the separate parts of a railway; but a large share of
the value of the locomotive is the result of the nice adjustment of these
separate parts to each other and to the work to be done.</p>

<p class='c000'>Take a hundred different-sized locomotives, each adapted to different
work under different conditions, and separate each piece of metal; it
would be possible to value all these parts, but the aggregate would be
far less than the value of the locomotives from which they were taken.
Again, it would be possible to construct from these parts a hundred
locomotives of such poor design, their respective parts so out of adjustment
and balance, that they would be worth even less than the parts
out of which they were assembled. The highest paid intelligence has
not yet contrived the perfectly balanced locomotive, but a large part of
the so-called "physical value" of every locomotive represents this sort
of highly paid intelligence put forth at every stage from the opening
of the mine where the ore was obtained to the delivery of the completed
locomotive. Take ten railways of a thousand miles each, every
one of them efficiently constructed, and equipped with proper terminals,
stations, signals, rolling stock, and trained employees, and each
properly adapted to the requirements of its territory and traffic;
separate them into piles of ties and rails, groups of locomotives and cars,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>acres of land, unorganized bodies of men of varied capacity and training;
what sort of intelligence will it require to build up out of these masses
ten railways as efficient and useful as those that originally existed?
Why, then, should the "physical value" of the locomotive include the
assembling of its parts in proper balance and the "physical value" of
the railway exclude the cost of the much more complicated adjustment
of its elements of machinery and labor and location to each other?</p>

<p class='c000'>At an early point in his discussion, Mr. Riggs makes an announcement,
highly becoming on the part of one who proposes to deal with
the problem solely from the point of view of a civil engineer, that he
does not intend to argue the public utility of any sort of valuation,
but only the method by which it may best be made, should one be
determined upon. He says:</p>

<p class='c018'>"This paper is confined to a discussion of the methods which should
be used in arriving at a correct figure of cost of reproduction and
depreciation—it does not take up questions involving the propriety
of those figures when reached. The propriety or legality of using such
figures as a basis for an assessed valuation, as a basis for rate-making
(rate-making being an art in itself involving complications as great as
those encountered in valuation), or any arguments as to the justice or
injustice of legislation restricting issues of stocks or bonds, will be
conceded no place in this paper. It is assumed that all these questions
would have been taken up and a satisfactory answer reached before a
valuation could have been ordered."</p>

<p class='c000'>Two pages after the foregoing paragraph, under the sub-heading
"The Relation of Public Service, or Quasi-Public Corporations, to the
People," Mr. Riggs proceeds to violate the wise, though self-imposed
restriction, and devotes no less than eleven pages to a defense of the
project on grounds of alleged public policy. In these pages he concludes
that such a valuation as he proposes—not a mere determination
of replacement costs, but a real valuation, with proper allowance for
all elements of value in use—would be of service in connection with
(<em>a</em>) taxation, (<em>b</em>) public control of rates, and (<em>c</em>) public control of
issues of capital securities.</p>

<p class='c000'>In supporting valuation as an expedient in taxation of railway
property, Mr. Riggs seems to rely on a table made up from Professor
Adams' Bulletin No. 21, as expert employed by the Federal Bureau
of the Census, which table shows that the assessment of the railways of
Wyoming for taxation purposes in 1904 was but 7.5% of their commercial
valuation, as estimated by Professor Adams, and that this ratio
varied greatly throughout the different States, running as high as
114.4 in Connecticut. Of course, nearly every one knows, even if Mr.
Riggs does not, that the relation between the real value and the
assessed value of all other kinds of property varies greatly from State
to State, and even in different portions of the same State. On account
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>of this variation, no table such as that offered by Mr. Riggs in support
of his argument can have any value unless supplemented and explained
by data covering the assessment of other kinds of property. It is
worth noting, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">en passant</span></i>, that the so-called "Commercial Valuation,"
on which Mr. Riggs rests this part of his argument, assigns a value
equivalent to $32,054 per mile to the railways of Michigan and one of
$45,211 per mile to the railways of the prairie State of Nebraska.
Possibly this variation in the estimate of value is partly expressed in
the conclusion that Michigan railways are assessed at 70.9% of their
value and Nebraska railways at but 18.5 per cent. Obviously, there is
no more need of uniformity among the States in the taxation of railway
property than in their methods of deriving revenue from other
kinds of property.</p>

<p class='c000'>Also, Mr. Riggs admits that, when the Michigan valuation for
taxation was made, it was not diminished, as it should have been, by
the use of negative, non-physical value. This is fully equivalent to an
admission that the method was unjust to every railway not capable of
earning the full return on its replacement cost. He says:</p>

<p class='c018'>"The use of a negative or subtractive non-physical value was considered,
and advised by Professor Adams....</p>

<p class='c018'>"Professor Adams and his associates, therefore, applied only positive
values, where any such were found, although advocating the use of
negative values."</p>

<p class='c000'>And, of the method then used, he says:</p>

<p class='c018'>"... it fails, in the form in which it was used in 1900 and
1902, to bring out those negative or subtractive elements which may be
determined from the income accounts, in the case of properties which
do not earn a fair return on the investment."</p>

<p class='c000'>And again:</p>

<p class='c018'>"... where the earnings have been fairly uniform and stationary
for a period of years, and the property does not earn a sufficient
sum to care for depreciation and annuity, it is clear that the value as
an earning investment is less than the determined physical value, and
that the physical valuation should be reduced by some amount to
arrive at the 'fair value.'"</p>

<p class='c000'>In his argument favoring the use of a valuation in rate-making,
Mr. Riggs affords no support to Professor Adams' contention that, for
that purpose, only replacement cost should be considered, and that,
after fixing the rates on the basis of the least favorably located and
least efficient line, so as to afford it a bare return on its replacement
cost, the surplus earnings at the same rates of its more favorably
located or better operated competitors should be confiscated under the
guise of a special tax. This extraordinary proposal, the character of
which is so illuminating as to the attitude toward railway property
and investments of the most prominent and persistent advocate of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>so-called "physical valuation," is best stated in Professor Adams' own
words, which are as follows:</p>

<p class='c018'>"I cannot evade the conclusion that equity, as between various
classes of roads, can never be attained until all the excess of revenue
over the Constitutional limit be made a contribution to the public
treasury, and that this contribution be made as a substitute for all
taxes of all kinds and all sorts."<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c003'><sup>[38]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>On the contrary, Mr. Riggs distinctly upholds the right to earnings
in excess of the bare return, at the minimum rate of interest, upon
the cost of replacement, saying, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">inter alia</span></i>:</p>

<p class='c018'>"It is contended that the determination of rates that will be just
and fair to all competing companies involves other consideration than
the valuation of either physical or intangible properties, and that when
all these rate-making problems are properly solved, there will remain
large intangible values on the well-designed plants."</p>

<p class='c000'>Professor Adams has himself admitted that there is no possibility
of utilizing any valuation for the purpose of fixing specific rates, as
such a task is far beyond the capacity of any conceivable system of cost
accounting. Supplementing this admission, Mr. Riggs' opposition to
the plan proposed by the former and its gross injustice, so apparent
to every one but its author, destroys the last element of plausibility in
the suggestion that any sort of valuation could be of utility in that
connection. The writer is not overlooking the fact that the Courts,
when under the necessity of repelling efforts to confiscate railway
properties under the guise of rate regulation, and in view of the form
in which this necessity has commonly presented itself, have accepted
"fair value" as an element of importance in their inquiries; but if
the railways are entitled to charge rates based on the value of the
services they perform, it is clear that the question whether a rate or a
schedule of rates is reasonably adjusted to the value of the service or
services is very different from the question whether a fair return upon
fair value has been allowed. Assuming, however, the need of an
appraisement in every litigated case involving railway schedules, it is
evident that each case would have to have its own appraisement, for
value is ever changing and unstable. Mr. Riggs himself says:</p>

<p class='c018'>"It is true that the 'value' of a property is an unstable figure, subject
to fluctuations due to natural or artificial causes, and that a
material change in value may occur suddenly...."</p>

<p class='c000'>Professor Adams proposed to keep his replacement cost up to date
by annual accretions equal to annual expenditures for extensions and
betterments; but this plan is illogical and inconsistent, for it proposes
to ignore that very essential difference between original cost (less a
proportionate allowance for wear and tear) and present worth, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>is the very basis of the argument in favor of any valuation at all.
Equally obvious objections, growing out of the instability of the ascertained
value of any particular date, apply to any plan which does not
provide for a re-appraisement every time the aggregate is to be used.</p>

<p class='c000'>The objections to the use of any valuation for rate-making which
have been cited are valid, and should be convincing, but they are
insignificant by the side of the fundamental objection that, as Mr.
Riggs says, "as a business proposition, the value of any property depends
on its earnings," while those who would thus utilize a valuation are
attempting to reverse the fact and make earnings depend on the value.
Such a reversal is impossible. Ascertain real value and you have a consequence
of earnings, past, present, and prospective, nothing else; use
this as a basis for a rate schedule and you get, as a mathematical
result, the present rates. The only way to derive any other result from
this method would be to use as the basis some figure other than the
real value, a method which would only be resorted to through moral
turpitude or intellectual incapacity. One might almost assume that
Mr. Riggs knows this, for he says:</p>

<p class='c018'>"Value is given to a property, either by reason of the fact that it is
an instrument for earning profit, or that it does earn profit or gives
promise of profit."</p>

<p class='c000'>The substance of Mr. Riggs' argument on capitalization control is
that American railways are not often over-capitalized, but such evils
do obtain in other industries, and therefore railway issues of capital
securities ought to be restricted.<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c003'><sup>[39]</sup></a> Unfortunately, he gives no clue
to the methods he would have applied, nor as to how far he would
go in interference with the normal action and interaction of commercial
forces in determining what securities can and ought to be issued.
Railways are not over-capitalized. Table 9, a comparison of official
valuations and capitalization, originally compiled by Mr. Slason
Thompson, is instructive.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>In view of frequent suggestions, in the public press and elsewhere,
which indicate that there is a widespread opinion that the securities
of railways have generally been watered, Table 10 is given. It is an
analysis of the consolidated balance sheet as given in the reports of the
Interstate Commerce Commission for 1908 and 1890.</p>

<p class='c000'>Table 11 shows the length, in miles, of main and other tracks in
1908 and 1890.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Commission, in its annual report, shows the securities issued
per mile of road (first main track), but does not show the results per
mile of main track (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span></i>, 1st main track, 2d, 3d, 4th, and other main
tracks), nor does it show the results per mile of all tracks (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span></i>, main
tracks, yard tracks, passing tracks, and industrial tracks). From the
consolidated balance sheet, it will be noted that the securities per mile
of road have increased 29%, while per mile of main track they have
increased only 24%, and per mile of all tracks they have increased but
14 per cent. However, deducting the investments in stocks and bonds
of other corporations, and showing the results only for the securities
issued on account of the cost of road and 12% equipment, we have
an average per mile of road of $62,388, an increase of 12%; and an
average per mile of all main tracks of $56,166, an increase of 8%;
and an average per mile of all tracks of $42,864, or a decrease of
0.7 per cent. It will be noted that a considerable part of these increases
is due to increased cost of equipment, and the advantageous results
obtained from such investment have been clearly shown. Of the investment
in the track itself (cost of road), it will be noted that the cost
per mile of main track has increased only 5%, while the cost per mile
of all tracks shows a slight decrease in 1908 as compared with 1890.</p>

<p class='c000'>These comparisons are more significant and convincing in the light
of the large expenditures since 1890 for the reduction of grades,
revision of line, interlocking towers, automatic block signals, increased
weight of rail, increased capacity of bridges, improved stations and
terminals, elevation of tracks, and the many other items going to
make up the additions and betterments, and increasing the book cost
of the property. The figures plainly prove that there has been no
general practice on the part of the railroads of the country, from 1890
to date, of issuing capital securities without securing full value for the
vast amount referred to. Why, then, should any restriction be placed
on the form or manner of their future appeal for the very large volume
of capital necessary to keep abreast of American industrial development?
Why should they be limited as to what form of security they
may offer in return for the cash capital which they must obtain if they
are to serve the public adequately and properly?</p>

there could be no lawful mode for the revision of existing capitalization,
should it in any instance be found to be too small or too great

securities must be controlled by the necessities of the carriers and the

The law cannot compel any company to repudiate any existing security,

such an impairment of contract rights; public policy will not permit
in practice restrictions that would prevent the issue of securities to

<p class='c018'>"The Interstate Commerce Commission in 1908 report that their Balance Sheet covers
'miles of road' aggregating 213,888.36 miles, whereas their statement of mileage represents
all roads reporting to the Commission whether or not they furnished a Balance Sheet.</p>

<p class='c018'>"To analyze the Consolidated Balance Sheet, we have revised the statement of mileage
to cover same roads as are included in the General Balance Sheet. The 'miles of road,' <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span></i>,
miles of first main track, are actual. The Commission's report not showing separately for
each line the miles of other main tracks or yard tracks and sidings, the figures shown in the
statement of mileage are <em>approximate</em>. It includes mileage of all second, third and fourth
tracks. Undoubtedly, practically all of the second tracks, third tracks and fourth tracks
are owned, or operated by, roads furnishing the Commission with a Balance Sheet. Mileage
of Yard Tracks and Sidings is based on the proportion which the single-track mileage
of roads represented in the Balance Sheet bears to the total single-track mileage of roads
reporting to the Commission."</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Riggs considers <em>seriatim</em> nine objections to the ordinary
methods of estimating cost of replacement which were mentioned
specifically by the writer, as among the most important commonly
omitted items, in an address before the New York Traffic Club,
delivered during January, 1909. He concedes that the writer is correct
in urging that allowances for "working capital with which to
carry on the business" and for "impact and adaptation" ought to be
included, and were omitted in Michigan and have been usually omitted.
These are two of the nine objections specifically raised. As to five
others, Mr. Riggs seems to be in considerable doubt. Concerning the
objection that an allowance of 3% for interest during construction is
too low, he contends that it was justified in Michigan by the "assumption,"
that the whole work of replacement would be accomplished in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>one year, and also "that on long roads partial operation would commence
as various sections of the line were completed." He admits that
these assumptions "clearly would not be proper" under different conditions,
but appears to hold that they were warranted as to the Michigan
work.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another of the writer's objections was the absence of an allowance
for "wear and tear of materials during the period of construction."
As to this, Mr. Riggs says:</p>

<p class='c018'>"This deterioration is a necessary incident to any construction
work. It has not been customary or usual to take account of it. To
add to the amount capitalized on account of this item would be manifestly
improper. The only way in which this could be cared for would
be in an adjustment of the depreciation reserve when raised to cover
that which takes place during the construction period."</p>

<p class='c000'>Of course, the depreciation account, when there is one, is a charge
to operation. Therefore, Mr. Riggs' anxiety to disagree with the
writer has led him into a frame of mind in which he is prepared to
find that it is "manifestly improper" to charge to capital the real cost
of construction, but is quite proper to charge to operation a part of the
cost of construction, even though this results in carrying into the
operating account items of expense incurred long before operation
began or could have begun.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Riggs thinks that the writer was incorrect in objecting that
"a uniform price for earthwork was used, thus ignoring the varying
character of soil and length of haul," but he admits that there was
"practically no classification in the Southern Peninsula of Michigan,
or, in fact, on 90% of the mileage of the State," and his defense goes
no further than to assert that "the price * * * was not much
out of the way when considered as a fair average for the territory."</p>

<p class='c000'>His criticism of the objection to the use of a uniform price list for
materials, and ignoring the source of supply and the cost of delivery
at the point of use, is equally forced, for it admits that "no effort was
made to use different unit prices as between counties," and only
contends that "in a number of cases" differences in prices were made.</p>

<p class='c000'>The absence of an allowance for interference by labor troubles,
weather conditions (which he admits are "a frequent source of annoyance,
delay, and sometimes of expense"), Mr. Riggs defends on the
ground that it is "an expense difficult to separate and set up," and
therefore ought to be covered by an allowance for contingencies. On
the same ground, he could easily carry every item of cost of replacement
into the contingent account.</p>

<p class='c000'>The two remaining objections specifically raised by the writer are
squarely attacked by Mr. Riggs. As to one of them, the propriety of
an allowance for carrying charges up to the time of attaining a revenue
basis, has been admitted by the Railroad Commission of Wisconsin,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>but it is a broader question than ought here to be discussed. The
writer will only suggest, at present, that in some form or other, these
charges must be on the whole and in the long run met out of net
operating income, and that the cheapest way, for the user of the
services supplied, is to carry them into the capital account—otherwise
there must be an early amortization of this item, which cannot do
otherwise than to throw a heavy burden on the early schedules of
charges. The language of the Wisconsin Railroad Commission on this
subject merits quotation, and is as follows:<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c003'><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>"But new plants are seldom paying at the start. Several years are
usually required before they obtain a sufficient amount of business or
earnings to cover operating expenses, including depreciation and a
reasonable rate of interest upon the investment. The amount by which
the earnings fail to meet these requirements may thus be regarded as
deficits from the operation. These deficits constitute the cost of building
up the business of the plant. They are as much a part of the cost
of building up the business as loss of interest during the construction
of the plant is a part of the cost of its construction. They are taken
into account by those who enter upon such undertakings, and if they
cannot be recovered in some way, the plant fails by that much to yield
reasonable returns upon the amount that has been expended upon
it and its business. Such deficits may be covered either by being
regarded as a part of the investment and included in the capital upon
which interest is allowed, or they may be carried until they can be
written off when the earnings have so grown as to leave a surplus above
a reasonable return on the investment that is large enough to permit it.
When capitalized, they become a permanent charge on the consumers.
When charged off from the surplus, they are gradually extinguished.
(These facts alone, however, do not always furnish the best or most
equitable basis for the disposal of such deficits.) Whether they should
go into the capital account, or whether they should be written off, as
indicated, are questions that largely depend on the circumstances in
each particular case."</p>

<p class='c000'>The other objection that is squarely opposed by Mr. Riggs is the
refusal to allow for unavoidable discounts on the securities sold. Here
he quotes with complete approval an unnamed writer, who contends
that the impropriety of such an allowance is proven because, as between
an issue of $10,000,000 in bonds (par value) at 4% and at 4½%, the
4% bonds bringing 90 and the 4½% selling at par, there is an
annual saving, in issuing the 4% of $50,000 in interest, and that, if
the issue is to be for fifty years, this saving is $2,500,000, or $1,500,000
in excess of the discount. Of course, these figures are correct, but both
Mr. Riggs and his unnamed authority seem strangely to have overlooked
the fact that if a railway construction requires $10,000,000, it cannot
be obtained by issuing $10,000,000 in par value at 90. The comparison,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>of course, ought to be based on the issue of enough bonds at each rate
to obtain equal sums of money. As $10,000,000 in par value of bonds
sold at 90 would produce $9,000,000, the following comparison is based
on the issue of enough bonds at each rate payable in fifty years to
secure that sum.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of course, the foregoing figures are not absolutely accurate, for the
real net loss in the issue of the 4% rather than the 4½% bonds at these
prices would be the difference between the $5,000 annual saving in
interest and the amounts which would have to be set aside annually
for fifty years to produce $1,000,000, the amount of the discount, at
the end of that period. But the table is sufficiently accurate to expose
the curious error into which Mr. Riggs has fallen. Perhaps it will
convince him that it would be better, hereafter, not to stray so far
outside the field of civil engineering.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Riggs has little sympathy with those railway men who venture
to express the opinion that regulation ought not to extend so far as to
render it impossible to conduct the railway business in a business-like
way. His animadversions on railway men in general have already
been illustrated herein. He finds nothing worse with which to characterize
a previous utterance of the writer's than to say of it:</p>

<p class='c018'>"The manifest impatience with all forms of governmental interference
with corporations, which so often characterizes the utterances
of prominent railway officials, appears in this paper to a marked
degree."</p>

<p class='c000'>At the risk of incurring further displeasure, the writer will not
omit now to observe that, in his judgment, the whole question whether
railways shall be generally and officially valued, and how and by whom
the task shall be performed, is primarily conditioned by the country's
need of managing its legislative control of railway methods so as not
to restrict unduly the flow of capital into that industry. The steady
pressure for legislation during the last five years has so extended
legislative regulation that, for the first time, the sturdy, frugal, conservative,
"small investor" stands in the forefront of the problem. His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>views of the stability and future prosperity of the American railway
industry now dominate the situation. What they are may be read in
the facts attending recent efforts to finance necessary improvements of
old and prosperous railways. It developed before the Interstate Commerce
Commission during the recent hearings in connection with the
proposed partial adjustment of rates to the diminished purchasing
power of the money in which they are paid, that one of the greatest
of Eastern railway systems, paying 8% annual dividends on its stock,
which is very widely distributed, had offered new shares to its stockholders
at a premium of 25%, and had found them unsalable at that
figure, so that it was obliged to recall the offer and put them out at par.
Other testimony disclosed the failure of one great company to obtain
an offer of more than 85 for its 4% bonds, while another had been
forced to go to France to raise $10,000,000, and many others have been
forced to the expedient of issuing short-term notes at relatively high
rates of interest. It also appeared that extensive proposals for new
branch lines had been abandoned or postponed, in view of the impossibility
of obtaining funds on reasonable terms.</p>

<p class='c000'>Other testimony shows that locomotive shops and car builders are
putting out not more than half of their capacity; that the supply
trade is receiving no new orders. Never, since the beginnings of the
American railway industry, has the American and foreign investor
been so reluctant to supply necessary capital, or so doubtful of the
future of railway enterprises. This fact is not due to absence of confidence
in the industrial future of the American people, but is directly
attributable to the unanswered inquiry as to how far the policy of
legislative control is to extend. Either this question must be answered
in a manner satisfactory to the investor, or the credit of the Government
must be made available for the extension and improvement of
railway facilities, either through Governmental guaranties of adequate
returns to capital, or through Government ownership; for adequate
and properly constructed and equipped railways the public must and
will have. Thus far, the American public is ready neither for Federal
guaranties nor for Federal ownership; it is to be hoped that it will never
be ready for either. In this situation, if a Federal valuation is to be
undertaken, it is primarily important that it should be under such
auspices and by such methods that the investor will not be alarmed
as to its consequences. This is not a suitable occasion to attempt to
lay down all the considerations applicable to such a valuation, but it
ought to be perfectly clear that it must relate to value in use, not to
some concept of value limited to replacement cost which excludes some
of the most important elements of value (which are also those most
worthy of a return, because they represent the highest and most difficult
social and industrial services), in order to obtain a means of excluding
these same elements from possibilities of adequate reward.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>One of the most important items to be considered is the "cost of
progress," which is sometimes referred to as "abandoned property," or
as "obsolescence." For illustration, in the revision of the grade and
line of a road, whereby the capacity of existing track is doubled, the
present instructions of the Interstate Commerce Commission require
the charge to operating expenses of the cost of that portion of the old
line no longer continued in use. If, however, the doubling of the
capacity of the line be secured by the construction of a second main
track, the entire cost of the new work can be charged to capital account
and paid for from the proceeds of the sale of capital securities. The
latter method becomes the easier to finance, but what of the comparative
results? Say, for example, the original cost of material of existing
property, including equipment, stations, yards, etc., was $10,000,000,
that the first main track cost $1,000,000, and that to double the capacity
of the main track would require a present expenditure of $1,000,000,
either for (1) a reduction of the grades and curves of the first main
track, or (2) for the construction of a second main track. The increase
in capacity is identical, but in the first case the cost of train service
to handle the tonnage is decreased 50%, and some reduction in maintenance
is secured, while in the second case no economies of operation
are effected, but the expenses may be increased. Undoubtedly, Road
(1) would be much more favorable than Road (2), yet the Commission
says a portion of the cost of perfecting Road (1) must be charged to
operating expenses, and cannot be capitalized. What general manager
will dare recommend such extensive improvements when the charging
of a portion of the cost to operating expenses will show the dividend as
unearned, and thus render the securities of the company no longer
legal investments for savings banks, trustees of trust funds, etc.? As
an alternative, he might permit the old line to remain, and by placing
thereon a few cars occasionally, could consider it as still in use, and
carry it in his capital account, thus avoiding the charge to operating
expenses. Thus, again, is it the method and not the result that is
controlled by these instructions. What should be done is to permit the
cost to be charged against the surplus accumulated during the years in
which the property to be abandoned was used. This would not affect
adversely the operating income of the year, and would not impair the
credit of the Company.</p>

<p class='c000'>Plainly, the instructions of the Commission tend to compel a method
that is contrary to the economic law.</p>

<p class='c000'>Obviously, any requirement as to valuation which would impose
on the carrier such a result as that shown would compel the continuance
of the less efficient service and prevent the progress which such
replacements express. The railway business is a continuing one, and
an improvement ought to be made whenever it can earn income, not
only on its own cost, but on that of the property abandoned, even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>though it cannot afford income sufficient to wipe out the whole capital
charge for the latter in a single year. There is no reason for requiring
each item of capital to earn its cost in addition to its interest during
its individual life. Such a requirement would cry halt to progress. It
is reasonable and proper that such charges to operation should be made
as far as the rapid development of the art of transportation permits,
and such is the practice of every well-managed railway; but, to make
the practice uniform and compulsory, permitting no exceptions and
allowing no scope for individual judgment, is quite another thing.
When the conditions warrant such a course, the railway ought to be
permitted to adjust its accounts in a manner of which the following is
typical:</p>

<p class='c000'>A valuation adjusted in recognition of this developmental need would
include, in addition to the item of $15,000 for the replacement cost of
the new locomotive, an item representing "cost of progress" of $4,750
for the former locomotive. It is not to be overlooked that in actual
practice it would be easy to obtain this allowance by cumbering the
yards and round-houses with obsolete and superfluous equipment. The
plan of Professor Adams places a premium on such a course, and there
are many conditions under which it could and would be followed where
it would be less obvious and more detrimental. For example, it might
be that an additional track over a steep grade and a new alignment
which would avoid it would cost the same. The new alignment would
give greater operating efficiency, but it would require the charging off
of the old line; the new track over the grade would be more costly to
operate, but would leave the apparent capital unimpaired. It is such
possibilities as this that are giving pause to the investors who would
otherwise supply funds for the needed development of the American
railway system. How far this development has so far required the
abandonment of property capable of further use and having genuine
capital value is indicated by available records. The aggregate capacity
of all equipment has increased much faster than the increase in
number of locomotives and cars. The reports of the Interstate Commerce
Commission only show this information for the years 1902 to
1908, both inclusive. The average tractive power of locomotives in
1908 was 26,356 lb., as compared with 20,485 lb. in 1902, being an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>increase of 5,871 lb., or 28.7% per locomotive. The average capacity of
freight cars in 1908 was 35 tons, as compared with 28 tons in 1902, an
increase of 7 tons, or 25 per cent. Undoubtedly, the average capacity
of locomotives and the average capacity of freight cars in 1908 was not
less than 60% above the average capacity of 1890.</p>

<p class='c000'>L. F. Loree, M. Am. Soc. C. E., President of The Delaware and
Hudson Company, as Reporter (For United States) to the International
Railway Congress, held in Paris in 1900, communicated with all roads
in the United States then operating 500 miles of line, or more, relative
to the capacity of cars actually in service. The result is shown in
Table 12.</p>

<p class='c000'>As a result of these improvements in roadway and equipment, the
average number of tons of freight handled per freight train in 1908
was 351.80 tons, as compared with 296.47 tons in 1902, an increase of
55.33 tons, or 18.6 per cent. The average tons per freight train in 1908
was 351.80, as compared with 175.12 in 1890, an increase of 176.68 tons,
or 100.8 per cent.</p>

<p class='c000'>These improvements have not been solely or mainly for the benefit
of the carriers, though there is no question that they have been
prompted by railway self-interest. The new car of 40 tons capacity is
but 20% longer than the old car of 13 tons, which means a great
augmentation of the efficiency of the private sidings and tracks of the
manufacturers, as well as the side tracks and terminals of the railway.
Who would retrace the steps of progress of the last decade or of the
last two decades? Yet the project to tie railway earnings to replacement
cost, which makes no allowance for the costly steps in such
progress, is in reality a project to tie them to their present state of
development and to prohibit future progress. Nor can it be forgotten
that it is an inviolable law of Nature that that which does not go
forward must go backward—nothing can remain stationary.</p>

<p class='c000'>The story of the crude millionaire who wanted to know the value of
the "plant" of Oxford University, in order that he might duplicate it,
is not inappropriate, and ought to have some significance to those who
imagine that replacement cost would tell the story of railway values.
Do they imagine, because they are ignorant of them, that a great railway
organization carries no traditions of loyalty, of persistence in the
face of overwhelming difficulty, of generous recognition of public needs
and rights, of courageous adherence to the real interests of its shareholders
that inspire its personnel and provide a genuine <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit du
corps</span></i>? Do they find no superiority in one organization over another,
no systematic economies of method, no especial adaptation to economic
needs that has value more genuine than any replaceable element, and
is at least equally worthy of compensatory return?</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>If there were not abundant evidence that the railway industry is
not excessively profitable, there would be more reason on the side of
those who continually put forward new schemes of restriction; but,
not only is such evidence ample, but there is no evidence of any sort
tending to establish the contrary. Limiting the inquiry to the region
east of the Mississippi and north of the Ohio and Potomac Rivers,
commonly known as Official Classification Territory, the statement in
Table 13, based on the book cost of railways, with their equipment,
supplies, and materials on hand, is instructive. The data are from the
reports of the Interstate Commerce Commission.</p>

<p class='c000'>The amounts shown in Table 13 as "operating income" are, as
should be remembered, those earned, and not those distributed as
interest on bonds and dividends on shares, which were necessarily
much smaller. Bearing this in mind, it is significant that the percentage
of such operating income to cost of property has not but once
in the last twelve years, the most prosperous duo-decade in the Nation's
history, exceeded 6%, and then only by a very small fraction; and
that the average for the whole period is less than 5½ per cent. Every
one knows that the real value and the actual cost of the railway property
in this region greatly exceeds its book cost, so that these percentages
are undoubtedly much in excess of the real rates of net earnings to
value or cost of property.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>P. E. Green, Assoc. M. AM. Soc. C. E.</span> (by letter).—It is not often
that there is presented to the Society a paper which shows such
thoroughness of understanding of a difficult problem, and as much
real experience in its solution, as is manifested therein; and the
author is certainly to be congratulated on such a logical and forcible
presentation of the subject. There may be some points on which
engineers who have been engaged in such work cannot agree with
him; but certainly it cannot be said that he has not argued very clearly
and logically on nearly all the debatable questions.</p>

<p class='c000'>Those who have not had actual experience in making a valuation
of a railway company's property cannot have any idea of the enormous
amount of detail and labor necessary to make such a compilation of
any real value. It simply means that every detail of every structure
of whatever kind must be investigated, together with the various considerations
covering "intangible values," which the author has so ably
discussed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The writer was fortunate enough to be employed on the valuation
of the Chicago and Northwestern Railway property in Minnesota in
1906, and possibly some details of the manner in which the actual
field work of the survey was done may be of interest.</p>

<p class='c000'>The work consisted of making a compilation from records, or
from actual surveys when necessary, of about 625 miles of railway
property, including several important terminals. The property had
been built between 1860 and 1901, mostly in the early part of this
period. The portions which had been constructed during the latter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>part of the period, say from 1890 to 1906, presented no difficulties, as
the records were very clear and complete, but the portions constructed
in the Sixties had practically no records. Some had been built by
small independent companies, which were acquired later by the Northwestern
System. On these old lines the records were practically nil,
and those in existence were soon found to be of absolutely no use.
Even on the newer lines it was found that many changes had been
made within a few years after their construction, and that it was
sometimes more economical, as regards time at least, to make a new
survey of the property than to use the records.</p>

<p class='c000'>After examining all the old records very thoroughly, and endeavoring
to get some order and information out of them, it was decided that
the only way to do the work properly was to make a complete survey
and valuation of all the physical property. Several field parties were
organized and also an office force, about twenty men being put on the
work. The parties ran levels for profile purposes, cross-sectioned cuts
where necessary, noted evidences of clearing and grubbing, of the
character of the cuts, and the disposal of the material, examined the
ballast for depth and character, examined the rails for age, weight,
and condition, and noted the kind and condition of the fences, gates,
farm crossings, planking, whistle and highway-crossing posts, culverts,
bridges, and in fact every detail of construction. Advantage was also
taken of the survey to re-station the lines, to paint such stations on
the rails, and to set permanent posts, so that afterward the stationing
could be picked up at any time with little trouble.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this way there was accomplished much work of value to the
railway company, for which there had been a demand by the division
officials for years, but which had not been done because of lack of men
and money.</p>

<p class='c000'>No attempt was made to assign depreciation, as regards the rails;
this was determined afterward, from the age of the steel in the track.
It was necessary, however, to make quite a thorough inspection of the
ties, and to note their condition, as they were replaced year by year
singly as they wore out. Almost every conceivable kind of timber
had been used for ties at one time or another. Treated and untreated
ties lay side by side; and thus there was great difficulty in classifying
them with regard to the kind of timber. With bridge ties and
timbers of frame and pile bridges, there was not so much difficulty, as
they were open to inspection, and had been inspected twice yearly by
the Division Engineer and the Superintendent of Bridges and Buildings,
and accurate records of their condition and renewals had been
kept. The depth and condition of the ballast also varied very widely.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a very short time all the men on the survey became well
acquainted with the character of the work they had to do, and, as the
work went on, the progress of the party day by day was very much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>more rapid. At the beginning of the survey, a progress of 6 or 7
miles of single track was considered a very good day's work; at the
end of the survey, the parties were making from 12 to 15 miles
per day.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was considerable difficulty in setting proper values on the
hundreds of buildings, large and small, owned by the railroad. Most
of these buildings had never been constructed from plans, and it was
difficult to calculate what they had cost originally, and what it would
have cost to build them at the time of the survey. However, time books
were searched, and the contents of the buildings in board feet were
calculated, and, while in many cases their age was not known from
any records, it was nearly always possible to find out from somebody
just when they were erected.</p>

<p class='c000'>As intimated before, the railway company derived much actual
benefit from the work, outside of the accurate knowledge obtained as
to the value of the property itself. Steel charts, bridge records, etc.,
were established, and profiles, stationing, continuous bench-levels, etc.,
were all re-run or re-established; thus making the engineering work of
the future more consistent and uniform, and enabling more work to
be done with a smaller force. New maps of all the station grounds
and terminals were obtained, and all the records were put in better
shape than they had ever been before.</p>

<p class='c000'>Examination of some of the old terminals brought to light many
strange and out-of-date conditions. Old wrought-iron rails of antiquated
pattern, old cast-iron frogs, etc., of a pattern which had not
been in general use for fifty years, were found in the track. On some
of the little-used sidings, the old wrought-iron rails were so worn
that the tread of the rail was entirely gone, only the web remaining
to carry the traffic, and such rails were still in use.</p>

<p class='c000'>In such a valuation, also, many items, some of considerable magnitude,
were found which were extremely difficult to classify and assign
to their proper place. Such a one, for instance, as a soft, sand rock
deposit beside the track, which for many years had furnished engine
sand. Many thousand cubic yards of this material had been excavated,
but it had not gone into the roadbed as ballast, or to make fills, or to
widen embankments. It would hardly have been proper to classify
such excavation as grading, for it was an item of engine maintenance
and train operation. This is only one of numerous problems which
had to be solved.</p>

<p class='c000'>After all the survey had been made, most of the work of compilation
had to be done. Some of it had already been done in the office
by the small office force, but the great mass had to be done by the men
who did the work in the field. This task was of almost incomprehensible
magnitude. There were thousands and thousands of items, and
such a great mass of figures that the ordinary man would become lost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>in the maze. The data had to be checked and re-checked by men who
were not accountants, and sometimes most ludicrous mistakes were
discovered. However, it was at last accomplished, and the writer's
recollection of the "Present Value" of the Chicago and Northwestern
property in Minnesota is that it was somewhat more than $23,000,000
for the entire mileage (about 625 miles), or an average of about
$37,000 per mile of track. Hardly any of the mileage would be called
high-class or trunk-line track, but most of it might be classed as second-class
or important branch-line railway.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>E. Kuichling, M. AM. Soc. C. E.</span> (by letter).—This paper is a very
valuable addition to the literature of a comparatively new subject that
is rapidly attaining great political importance, and it gives abundant
evidence of deep research and thought by the author. The reasons for
determining the true value of such properties, as well as the general
principles of making the valuation or appraisal, have been set forth so
clearly and convincingly that little can be added in this respect; hence,
there is room for comment only about details.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the perplexing questions is the determination of the proper
value of the right of way and real estate of a railroad. The land was
originally acquired at a certain cost, essentially for public use, and in
the course of time its value, as determined by reproduction cost,
usually becomes greatly increased by the development of the adjacent
land by its various owners. Without the railroad, such development
and appreciation of land values would probably not have occurred, and,
therefore, it has been argued by many persons that, for taxation purposes,
the railroad lands should be appraised at only their original cost,
while, for capitalization purposes, they should be appraised at a value
measured by that of the adjacent land at the present time. This claim
is based on the theory that the railroad is like any other piece of
public work, such as a canal, highway, or pavement, which is built for
the use of the public, and on which no tax is levied by State or
municipality. On the other hand, it has been held by some of our
Courts that a proper valuation must take into account the appreciation
or depreciation of land values; but, as the opinion of a Court is not
unalterable, the soundness of this doctrine cannot be regarded as permanently
established.</p>

<p class='c000'>The author states<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c003'><sup>[41]</sup></a> that there can be no serious objection to this
doctrine in relation to rights of way in the country and small towns,
although he admits that it is subject to exceptions in the case of cities
and terminal and dock properties. It will be of great interest to learn
his reasons for making such exceptions in the case of the most costly
lands, and whether the valuation of such lands should be more or less
than that of similar adjacent lands used for other purposes. From the
context the inference may be drawn that the valuation should be somewhat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>higher than that of adjacent similar land in the case of a steam
or interurban railroad, because its holdings form a continuous strip;
but to the writer this reasoning does not appear satisfactory. The
statement of the Court, that "the value of land depends largely upon
the use to which it is put and the character of the improvements upon
it," does not necessarily involve a higher valuation of the property than
its cost, and it is quite conceivable that the actual value of the property
after being taken by a railroad may be much less than it was before.
The only reason in such a case for maintaining the purchase price is
to conserve the general valuation of the adjacent similar real estate.</p>

<p class='c000'>In dealing with the subject of depreciation, the author has been
very brief, as he did not consider it essential for the purposes of the
paper. This is to be regretted, as depreciation is an important feature
in every valuation, and so few trustworthy data concerning it are
available. The value of the paper would be greatly enhanced if the
author would give the assumed average life of the principal components
of a railroad, based on some definite traffic, and normal
grades and curves. Much diversity of practice in this respect prevails,
and the final judgment of the numerous experts who were engaged in
the Michigan valuations cannot fail to be of great interest. The same
remarks are also applicable to the unit prices adopted for construction
and equipment.</p>

<p class='c000'>The subjects of expenses for organization, engineering, administration,
contingencies, and non-physical values are treated very thoroughly
by the author, and particularly interesting is his discussion of the
complex question of franchise value. After quoting from numerous
judicial opinions, he reaches the conclusion that the franchise simply
protects the owners of the property in their enjoyment of the earnings,
and that its value merges into the "fair value" of the property and
becomes inseparable from the other non-physical elements of value;
also, that the aggregate non-physical value of the property depends
only on the net income for a period of years. This method of estimation
certainly has the merit of being simple, rational, and free from
all hypothetical considerations. It is, however, obviously governed by
the rates charged for the services rendered, and if these are likely to be
altered at any time by governmental action, a corresponding alteration
in the "fair value" of the property will take place.</p>

<p class='c000'>This consideration brings us at once to the intricate question of
reasonable rates, which involves the matter of reasonable design and
construction of the property. In most cases the working capacity of
the plant must be much greater than the average annual demand for
the service performed, as so-called "peak loads" of relatively short
duration must be provided for. The magnitude of these peak loads,
however, varies with the subsequent development of the territory, which
is necessarily conjectural; hence it follows that a comparatively large
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>amount of capital is often invested in an enterprise for the purpose of
taking care of such anticipated temporary demands, and on this investment
a "fair return" should be granted. This condition is particularly
noticeable in municipal water-works plants, where provision must be
made for supplying water for fire service to an extent which may be
several times greater than the normal hourly rate of consumption. In
the case of railroads, such demands can usually be met by adding to the
rolling stock at moderate expense, while in a water-works the outlay
is relatively greater because the entire plant must be adapted in the
outset to the anticipated maximum delivery in the course of a comparatively
long period of time.</p>

<p class='c000'>The problem of rate-making has been excluded by the author from
his present paper on valuation; but, inasmuch as he is so well qualified
for the task, and also because the non-physical value of the property
depends mainly on the rates obtained for the service rendered, it is
hoped that he will deal with this feature in a subsequent paper, thereby
bringing out a discussion on the obscure subject of "fair return." It
is noticeable that these phrases occur frequently in judicial opinions,
but the fundamental principles on which a definite conclusion should
be reached are seldom set forth clearly.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Richard T. Dana, M. AM. Soc. C. E.</span> (by letter).—The solution of
this problem includes practically all the factors in the general subject
of economics, in which engineering occupies a large but by no means
preponderant part. Mr. Riggs has done some very valuable and pioneer
work in contributing this paper at this time; and the writer, in calling
attention to what appears to be a radical error in it, does not wish to
be taken as attempting to detract in any way from its great value as
a whole. It is most important, in the inception of such an investigation,
on the part of the members of this Society, to remove from the
subject the stumbling blocks as they appear.</p>

<p class='c000'>The author makes the following statement:</p>

<p class='c018'>"It is true that the 'value' of a property is an unstable figure, subject
to fluctuations due to natural or artificial causes, and that a
material change in value may occur suddenly, but the 'value' of any
given property on any given date is, or should be, from an engineering
standpoint, a definite sum which may not be varied or changed to suit
the whim or will of the people for whom the work is done."</p>

<p class='c000'>The fundamental conception of a value is so important in an investigation
of this kind that it is worthy of careful and thorough
discussion.</p>

<p class='c000'>The appraisals which the writer has had occasion to make have
generally been for one or other of the following purposes, namely:</p>

  <dl class='dl_5'>
    <dt>(I)</dt>
    <dd>Taxation, in the interest of the community or corporation taxed;
    </dd>
    <dt>(II)</dt>
    <dd>Bonding, in the interest of the banker or representative of persons who contemplated
    lending money on the property;
    </dd>
    <dt>(III)</dt>
    <dd>Rate-making, in order to determine what was a fair amount of money that the property
    should be allowed to earn for the owners.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>Now, in general, a proper value for any property for any one of
these purposes is different from its proper value for any of the
others. This proposition is of immense significance, for the reason that,
if the value for the property arrived at, on one basis, be accepted and
applied for one of the other purposes, it will inevitably result in gross
injury and financial loss to some one.</p>

<p class='c000'>In attacking this problem, one must be careful to take the correct
standpoint, which is not necessarily that of engineering. Engineering
science is indispensable for a large part of the work, but there are
other indispensables, which would not ordinarily be recognized as
engineering. The writer takes the view that engineering is a part of
economics, rather than economics being a part of engineering.</p>

<p class='c000'>To illustrate this point, consider two objects, one of which is concrete
and simple and the other more complex.</p>

<p class='c018'>(1) A steam shovel belonging to a railroad, costing $10,000, new;</p>

<p class='c018'>(2) The entire railroad as an operating entity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Assume for (1) that the shovel has been purchased recently, is in
perfect condition, and that the railroad has some work for it to commence
on as soon as it can be properly installed. What is its:</p>

  <dl class='dl_5'>
    <dt>(I)</dt>
    <dd>Taxable value,
    </dd>
    <dt>(II)</dt>
    <dd>Bonding value, and
    </dd>
    <dt>(III)</dt>
    <dd>Rate-making value?
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c000'>(I) The tax assessor cannot properly appraise it at $10,000, because
it certainly would not sell for that sum, and if the community should
have to sell it for taxes the actual return minus the charges would be
so much less than the $10,000 that the community's books would show
a heavy loss; and this practice, if largely indulged in, would bring the
community into financial straits. The community must be exceedingly
conservative in its estimate, for this very reason; and, therefore, it has
been customary, almost universally, to tax such articles practically on
their sale value at what might be called panic prices. The company
which sold the shovel to the railroad would not buy it back two days
after the sale for more than the original price minus what that company
considers its selling charges, say 20%; so that, in this case, even
if a customer were at the door, the shovel would not be worth more
than $8,000, and a fair tax appraisal could not consistently be more
than $8,000 minus charges of, say, $250, or $7,750.</p>

<p class='c000'>(II) Assuming that the railroad is a very small one, that it wants
to borrow money, and desires to put up the shovel as collateral for the
loan. What would be its loan value to the lender? In considering
this point, it is necessary to assume that no aid is rendered by the credit
of the railroad itself, but that the protection for the loan is to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>furnished by the shovel only. Now, the banker will reason that, in the
event of the note remaining unpaid, he will have to sell the shovel to
reimburse the bank for its loan, and he will be required to consider
the matter on a conservative basis. He cannot lend on the shovel up
to its full value, for in the first place it is not a "negotiable security."
If it were a security, with a free market on some stock exchange, he
would probably lend to the amount of 80% of its value, but a steam
shovel in a sand bank on a railroad is by no means as convenient of
exchange, nor as easy to foreclose on as a stock certificate in a banker's
box; therefore he will lend, or he ought to lend, less than 80% of its
sale value, minus the selling charges. If he lends more than this, he is
lending on the credit of the owner of the shovel rather than on the
shovel itself. Granted that the maker of the shovel is willing to buy it
back at its full selling price less the selling cost, the maximum loan
value of the shovel would be a little less than 64% of its purchase
price, or $6,400. To lend more than this on the shovel would not be
conservative banking.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is another bonding or loan value to this shovel, when it is
considered as part of the assets of the railroad, the bonds of which are
to be held by the banker, under which circumstances a higher value
than $6,400 would be admissible.</p>

<p class='c000'>(III) If the value is to be determined with a view of ascertaining
what is a reasonable figure that the owner of the shovel ought to be
allowed to earn as a public utility organization, the problem is entirely
distinct from the foregoing two cases. Assume that the railroad is
entitled to earn at least 6% on its investment in the shovel. Now, its
investment is $10,000, because that is the money that it cost; and
nothing had been credited to its account, since the shovel had just been
purchased and had not yet done any work. The shovel cannot be considered
as being worth more than its cost, and it can easily be shown
it is not worth less for rate-making purposes.</p>

<p class='c000'>These three illustrations, which are very briefly outlined, should
demonstrate the fact that there is almost no relationship between any
two of the different kinds of value which are being considered.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now, from the standpoint of the railroad as a whole:</p>

<p class='c000'>(I) Should railroad property be taxed on the basis of what the
entire railroad would bring on a foreclosure procedure? Obviously
not, because the railroad is taxed in sections. The Town of Squedunk
will tax the portion of the railroad that lies within that town, and will
have considerable difficulty in putting down as security for its own
bonds the locomotives and cars which go through once a week or twice
a day at 40 miles per hour. To cover partly the flitting assets, it taxes
the railroad on a franchise value. It may tax a railroad's land on the
same basis that it taxes land owned by private individuals, notwithstanding
the fact that when the railroad buys the right of way it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>generally has to pay more money per acre than the householder or the
farmer. This unit cost to the railroad may be two or three times that
to the farmer, yet the writer has never heard of a community attempting
to tax railroad property two or three times as heavily as adjoining
property used for private or commercial purposes.</p>

<p class='c000'>(II) On the other hand, this same property is an absolutely sound
asset for the railroad, and the railroad probably bought the property
from the proceeds of the sale of bonds. If the public service commissions
were to rule that the railroad may be allowed to issue bonds only
to the amount of the taxable value of the property which is to be held
as security for the bonds, the result would be an absolute paralysis
of railroad construction. A bond is an obligation to pay so much
interest for so many years, and to pay back the principal at the end
of its term. The bondholder is interested in the absolute regularity of
his interest, and in the security that lies behind the principal, and it
is to-day the custom of banking houses to consider a bond well secured
when, in a territory of reasonably rapid growth, the principal is earning
say twice the interest on its bonds, and when the cost of reproduction
is in excess of the amount of the bonds, provided that the
property is in good physical condition. If it should be necessary to
foreclose on the bonds, it is then reasonable to suppose that some
one else will buy it in for at least the amount of its bonded indebtedness.
What can this possibly have to do with the taxable value of the
track in the Town of Squedunk? One may be 1.5 times the other, or
three times the other, depending on a multitude of circumstances.</p>

<p class='c000'>(III) The value of the property for rate-making is a complex one
to determine, and, of course, there is no opportunity for a full discussion
of it here.  One point, however, will serve to establish
thoroughly the difference between this and taxable or bonding value.
If the community is prosperous and the business is a good one and
honestly managed, the railroad ought to be allowed to earn a reasonable
percentage, say, at least 6%, on what has been put into it. If the
community should decree otherwise, then people will not build railroads
for investment purposes, and all will lose money. Now, it is a
well-known fact that a new railroad's earnings have to grow for several
years before they are on a normal basis, and part of what the owners
of the property have put into it is, for example, the interest on its
cost before its earnings are on a normal basis. This may amount to
a considerable percentage of the original construction cost of the
property, if the business is several years in developing. Granted that
the community ought to allow the property to earn a reasonable
interest on what has been put into it, then the rate-making value will
be very much larger than the sum of the taxable valuation of all its
different parts. It will also be much greater than its bonding value,
because, as a bond proposition, it can borrow money up to a limited
percentage of what it is actually worth.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span><span class='sc'>George T. Hammond, M. Am. Soc. C. E.</span> (by letter).—The engineer
called on to fix the valuation of public service corporation property
has so little engineering literature on this special subject to guide
him that he must feel grateful to the author of this excellent paper
for adding so much of a kind that is very desirable.</p>

<p class='c000'>Estimating the cost of an engineering structure in advance of its construction
is one of the most ordinary professional duties, but how difficult
it actually is, and how much engineers differ with one another in
their estimates on the same structure! Perhaps there is no professional
duty which calls for so much study and so much experience, or which
tests so closely the ability and capacity of the engineer. How seldom professional
estimators agree with each other; or designing engineers with
contracting engineers; as witness the bids received at the public lettings
of contracts when compared with the engineers' estimates of cost; and,
if this is true, which no one will attempt to deny, how much more so
is it probable that estimators will disagree when they attempt to place
a value on works already completed, and in service, perhaps, for many
years, in which various changes in value have occurred, and in which
questions of fact are mixed with legal questions involving legal rights,
as well as financial questions.</p>

<p class='c000'>The tendency in all such valuations appears to be a mixing up of
things in general—like the witches' stew. Everything goes into the pot
and is boiled together until all becomes soup, at least until the official
commission, like the witches, considers it done and ready to be served
up in the form of a report. It is then observed that the substance
served out is of a complex nature; that the valuation of engineering
structures has become mixed with other and uncertain values; that the
whole value, as stated, is, after all, little better than the commission's
opinion of the value; and that another commission would reach a
different conclusion.</p>

<p class='c000'>The author states that the valuation of corporation property:</p>

<p class='c018'>"Should be the honest judgment of the men composing the commission,
as to the actual cost of reproduction, present physical value,
or 'fair value,' and should be ascertained by a systematic and scientific
method which takes into account all the facts concerning the property,
its physical value, its strategic location, its operating revenues and
expenses, and its franchises, rights, competition, opposition, and all
other tangible or intangible elements, which would affect values. The
method of valuation should be such as to minimize or entirely eliminate
all differences due to errors of personal judgment."</p>

<p class='c000'>This, it seems, complicates actual present values with conditions
which might, or might not, continue. Outside of the physical valuation
of the plant, which offers the easiest problem presented, how can
one fairly put a value on operating expenses and revenues, which
might be affected favorably or advisedly by good or bad management,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>and by numerous other complex and almost incomprehensible
circumstances.</p>

<p class='c000'>The tendency of all such commissions seems to be to confuse
together and mix up some things which are logically separate. Thus,
the value of the plant and franchise, good will, and present investment
or income value, etc., are too often taken together. The value of the
plant is dependent on the cost of reproduction, and also the depreciation
of the structures, as engineering structures, and should be based
on present prices for which the work could be replaced, minus the
depreciation, which is a question of engineering judgment and experience.
The other items of value are largely dependent on the situation
of the plant and its prospects as an income-producing property, and this
again is a matter of opinion, in which the opinions of financiers and
investors are sometimes of more moment than those of engineers.
The opinion of lawyers as to the value of the franchises and the cost
of the legal complications possible or probable must also enter into any
seriously worthy opinion as to value.</p>

<p class='c000'>The few salient lights in the picture of valuation, presented by the
author, serve especially to reveal the darkness which involves the whole
subject of valuation, estimating, and the use of cost data for such
purposes, and to suggest that, with all the wonderful progress on the
theoretical side of the profession, engineers have as yet advanced but
little in this division of the practical side—cost data, valuation, and estimating.
Engineers cannot compare the results of different estimators
and appraisers without sorrow and even shame for their ignorance, or
their incapacity to agree in the application of scientific principles and
the results of practical experience to this branch of their work.</p>

<p class='c000'>At present we would seem to be a long way from a method of
valuation, "such as to minimize or entirely eliminate all differences
due to errors of personal judgment."</p>

<p class='c000'>The method described as having been used by Professor Adams
seems to be at least an advance toward a logical and rational method
of getting at the value of corporation property, but it must be acknowledged
that we are as yet a long way from a perfect method of appraisal,
even of the physical values, to say nothing of the non-physical. He
held that as nothing visible or tangible gave support to the latter value,
it must be determined on the basis of information secured from the
income accounts of the company. This method of measure, it would
seem, is not unlike the celebrated dictum on the length of the Chancellor's
foot, "some Chancellors have a long foot, and some an indifferent
foot, and some a short foot"; therefore, a great English Chancellor
says, "the length of a Chancellor's foot should not be taken as a
measure of rights in equity." Thus, if the income of the company
is to be taken by the appraising engineers, or the gross income, it may
have to be given a different interpretation from the net income, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>if the surplus earnings depend on transient causes or on excessive rates
for service it will lead to a totally erroneous conclusion. The same
may be said if the rates for service are too low, or if the company is
badly managed, or is carrying a great deal of "dead wood," either in
the form of property or of servants. Therefore, it seems evident that
he who attempts to follow this method of appraisal must possess almost
superhuman judgment of present conditions, and prescience to forecast
the future, as well as a grade of wisdom and knowledge of existing
conditions of trade and industry which may be also characterized as
superhuman. In order to apply Professor Adams' method justly, we
must know whether the company is wisely managed, whether its income
is a fair income, whether its physical property is all useful and needful,
whether its service is what it ought to be as to efficiency and economy,
etc. We must assume an ideal condition of commerce and industry,
and of property value and management, and then appraise the company's
property by comparing it, consciously or unconsciously, with
this ideal. Possibly this is the best method devised so far, but surely
it leaves a great deal to be desired; and it is difficult to see how
different engineers, on different sides of the question, representing
different interests, can find any common ground of agreement in
Professor Adams' method. Under such circumstances, engineers are
likely to differ in their results as much as the length of the different
Chancellors' feet.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Leonard Metcalf, M. Am. Soc. C. E.</span> (by letter).—Mr. Riggs has
done engineers, and more particularly those interested in valuation
works, a genuine service in presenting to the Society this admirable
paper.</p>

<p class='c000'>No shrewd observer can fail to recognize the increasingly insistent
demand of the public for greater publicity in the accounting, and a
larger measure of governmental control in the operation, of public
service corporations. In its best form, such control will be welcomed
by the corporations, as giving greater stability to investment in such
property; in its worst, it may prove a serious limitation to prompt
development of the best standards of service. In the water-works field,
the anti-corporation movement has resulted in taking over by the
public many such plants. It does not seem likely, however, that we are
ready to go farther in the railroad field of operation than to demand
reasonable regulation of such corporations.</p>

<p class='c000'>While the writer has had no experience in railway management or
valuation, he has devoted much time and thought to the valuation of,
and determination of fair-rate schedules for, water-works properties;
therefore, what he may have to say in comment on this paper may be
assumed to have direct application to water-works valuation, and to
railroad valuation only as the similarity in the public service rendered
by these corporations may imply.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>In the main, the writer subscribes heartily to the views expressed
by the author and the temperate way in which he has expounded them.
Space forbids discussion in detail of all the matters alluded to and so
well covered by Mr. Riggs. On one important subject, however—the
inclusion of the going value, or going concern value, of public service
corporation property, in the intangible property values, rather than in
physical plant value, and the consideration of it as an intangible value
rather than as a real and substantial item of cost to the public service
corporation—the writer differs from the author. It is clear, from what
Mr. Riggs has said, that this is debatable ground, and, from the care
and fairness with which he has expressed his views on this subject,
one might almost be led to infer that he invites attack on it. It is
in no carping spirit of criticism, however, that the following views are
expressed.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the writer has recently submitted to the Publication Committee
of this Society a paper on the "Going Value of Water-Works," written
by him in collaboration with John W. Alvord, M. Am. Soc C. E., in
which a detailed discussion of this subject will be found, only enough
will be said to outline clearly his point of view.</p>

<p class='c000'>The author says:</p>

<p class='c018'>"The physical property is that which enables the corporation to do
business. Without physical property it could not produce the commodity
which it sells. The amount of money actually invested in
acquiring that physical property represents the measure of capital on
which it is morally entitled to earn interest and profit; and, in the
stage of promoting and financing the enterprise, all hope of earnings
is based on the amount of money required to construct the property."</p>

<p class='c000'>He also says:</p>

<p class='c018'>"It would seem reasonable to say that this difference between the
physical value and the value based on earnings represents the 'good
will,' 'established business,' or 'going value,' and all other non-physical
elements of value."</p>

<p class='c000'>In referring to going value, he says:</p>

<p class='c018'>"* * * Yet, to fix a value on it by the method described by him
[Mr. Alvord] involves going into the realm of conjecture and speculation
to a degree that could never be sustained. * * * It can be
readily seen that the physical present value is not always—indeed, is
not often—the 'fair value.' The 'fair value' may be more, or less, than
the present value of the physical property."</p>

<p class='c018'>"* * * Is it not, then, proper to conclude that the non-physical
or intangible value, composed of all these various elements
of value, can only be determined absolutely by a study of the earnings
and operating expenses? * * *"</p>

<p class='c000'>He also says:</p>

<p class='c018'>"The contention that all the different elements of non-physical
value merge into one intangible value, not capable of separation, will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>doubtless be objected to by many engineers and corporation managers. * * *"</p>

<p class='c018'>"The writer does not concede that 'going concern' is a proper
element to consider in the physical value, as it does not represent
any part of the cost chargeable to capital, and the physical valuation
should be confined to the determination of capital invested."</p>

<p class='c000'>Quotations might be multiplied. Those cited, however, will suffice
to recall the author's view, and to make clear the point with which
issue is taken.</p>

<p class='c000'>Is Mr. Riggs right in his contention that going value is in fact an
intangible value; that going value is not an element of real cost to
the company, involving investment of capital; that going value, therefore,
should not be included in physical plant value; and that the
company is not morally entitled to earn interest and profit on it?</p>

<p class='c000'>The writer contends that going value is as real an element of cost,
in the property of any public service corporation, as is the cost of any
portion of its physical plant. It pertains, however, to the business,
rather than to the physical plant, of the corporation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whatever the difficulties of its computation may be, whatever the
methods used—whether that adopted by the Wisconsin Public Service
Commission (which is essentially one of determining the original cost
of the going value and not its reproduction cost), or whether that
perhaps first outlined by Mr. Benezette Williams and George H.
Benzenberg, Past-President, Am. Soc. C. E., in the Middle West, and
by William Wheeler, M. Am. Soc. C. E., in the East,<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c003'><sup>[42]</sup></a> a method which
seeks to determine the reproduction cost of the going value, rather
than its original cost—the going concern value has come to be
recognized, by water-works appraisers at least, as a substantial element
in the cost of the plant, and hence as differing essentially from the
franchise element or so-called unearned increments of value.</p>

<p class='c000'>Is not going value in a "between" class—a middle ground between
tangible and intangible values—tangible in that it has involved real
cost and expenditure of money; intangible in that it is not as readily
calculated as are other reproduction cost items, is dependent fundamentally
on the earnings of the company, and that there is no tangible
equivalent to show for the expenditure, except the existing income of
the corporation? Surely its character is quite different from that
of the franchise, as ordinarily found, the value of which, while real,
from the rate-payers' point of view, seems to be made out of whole
cloth; in short, seems to be of fictitious value.</p>

<p class='c000'>Certainly, the conjectural and speculative character of the computations—as
referred to by Mr. Riggs—involved in the determination
of going value is no excuse for failure to recognize going value as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>real element of cost, rather than as an intangible value. As a matter
of fact, the variation in the views on going value, by engineers who
have given this subject particular study, while greater than the variation
in their estimates of the reproduction cost of the physical plant,
is still far less than the variation in their views on franchise value.</p>

<p class='c000'>As bearing on the proper basis for rate-making, the author's statement,
that the "* * * physical property represents the measure of
capital on which it [the public service corporation] is morally entitled
to earn interest and profit * * *" cannot be admitted, equitably or
legally; and it is not to be assumed that Mr. Riggs desired to imply
that this sentence summed up his final views.</p>

<p class='c000'>Are we not, however, approaching a basis of rate-making, predicated
on the earning, by public service corporations, of operation and
maintenance expenses, depreciation allowance, and return (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span></i>, interest
and profit) on reproduction cost of the property, less accrued
depreciation, plus going value, plus a nominal allowance for the franchise
and other intangible values of the corporation? Is it not possible
that the recent depression in the business world has been due, in considerable
measure, to the shrinkage in the values ascribed to franchise
and other intangible value in public service corporation property?</p>

<p class='c000'>If we are approaching such a limitation, it is the more important
that the public should be educated to the fact—not theory, for it is a
fact—that going value, or going concern value, is a real element
of cost, covering an outlay in effort and money on the part of the
corporation, and as such is as much entitled to earn a return (interest
and profit) as is the other capital invested in plant. It is not on any
items of real and necessary cost to the corporation that the public
objects to paying tribute, but on the "unearned increments" and the
virtual monopoly "privileges" enjoyed by the corporation and created,
in large measure at least, by the public itself and by normal conditions
of growth and development for which the public, rather than the
corporation, was perhaps responsible—though in many cases it may be
urged truly that the corporation itself, rather than the public, has been
responsible for the development.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such a basis of rating, while still dependent on sound judgment
and judicial treatment, is nevertheless not beset with the speculative
element involved in the capitalization theory, which, Mr. Riggs himself
admits, fails as a basis of rate-making except when predicated on
fair rates.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the writer's contention, that going value is a real element of
cost in the property of any public service corporation, is sound, Mr.
Riggs' statement that, "It appears to be doubtful whether the Court
can be construed as approving such an element of value in rate cases,"
and his interpretation of Judge Tayler's ruling in the Cleveland Street
Railway matter,<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c003'><sup>[43]</sup></a> must be challenged.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>Certainly, as applied to water-works valuation, Mr. Riggs' statement
is not justified. The Maine cases clearly include going value
as an element of value on which rates should be predicated; by inference,
so does the Kansas City case. In the Knoxville case it was in
fact allowed by the Master.</p>

<p class='c000'>In equity it cannot be doubted that going value should be included
in the base on which the returns are predicated, if, as contended, it
involves real cost to the company; for the company must be permitted
to earn a fair return on this cost, or to liquidate it in some way, as
otherwise the corporation would suffer substantial property loss—from
10 to 20%, more or less, of the reproduction cost of its property.
This would be contrary to public policy, for, with such an outlook,
capital would not enter this field of enterprise, except at increased
rates of return, commensurate with this added hazard. To assume
such increased rates of return is to provide another means of liquidating
such a loss.</p>

<p class='c000'>As to "good will," it has seemed to the writer more proper to use
this term in private competitive corporation enterprises, as applied
to the element of value corresponding to the going value of the quasi-municipal
or public service corporation enterprises, which latter are in
effect controlled monopolies. If the term is used in its more colloquial
sense, such as the effect on earnings of having, in the office of
the corporation, men who meet the public pleasantly, who are good
"mixers," and who are active in getting business, the value is substantially
included in the consideration of the income, in the manner
involved by going value determination and franchise valuation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The depreciation question has been discussed so fully elsewhere
that the writer only calls attention to the fact that, while physical
and functional depreciation only are to be considered in a review of
the present physical condition of any plant, in considering a fair-rate
schedule, provision should also be made for contingent depreciation,
covering such items as cost incident to change in street grades or construction
of subways; placing structures under ground, which were
previously above ground; serious loss due to injury by electrolysis, the
distribution of which over a period of years rather than inclusion in
the operating cost for one year, is to be preferred, alike from the public
and from the corporate point of view, from the fact that it spreads the
burden to be borne by the rates, and prevents violent fluctuation in
prices or valuation of the public service corporation's property. The
public pays dearly for all hazards. It is wise, therefore, to pursue the
conservative course in providing adequate funds to meet extraordinary
conditions, and to give stability to the investment of the corporation.
Moreover, such funds can be carried in a separate account which can
readily be watched; any excess can be credited to future reduction
in depreciation account requirements, while a prolonged deficit cannot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>perhaps be recovered by the corporation, in the light of the Knoxville
decision.</p>

<p class='c000'>The comment that no hard-and-fast rule can cover determination
of proper depreciation allowances, is amply justified. In its final
analysis, it is a matter of good judgment, experience, and judicial
temper.</p>

<p class='c000'>The author's statement that the organization, legal, engineering,
administration, and general expense accounts, "should not be considered
as affected by depreciation, as long as the property is a going
concern," is not quite clear. Obviously, this is true with regard to all
the early organization expenses, as these expenses are incurred once
for all, and constitute a continuing asset similar to other elements of
plant cost. If, however, the author refers therein also to the engineering
and contingent item added to many of the reproduction cost items
making up the physical property, exception must be made; for when
an old structure, the life of which is gone, is replaced with a new
structure, new engineering costs are incurred, and the engineering
element of cost incident to the installation of the original structure
no longer inheres in the plant. It, too, has passed away with the life
of the structure, and, therefore, its cost should be liquidated, or provided
for in the depreciation account, as well as the cost of the structure
to which it was incident.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the same way the "interest-during-construction" item is not a
continuing asset, but should be liquidated with the complete depreciation
of the portion of the structure to which it relates. The replacement
of the structure will involve new "interest-during-construction"
charges, commensurate with the time required for construction. The
value of the initial "interest-during-construction" costs will have disappeared
with the original structure and, therefore, should be taken
care of by the depreciation account.</p>

<p class='c000'>The method of making allowances for interest during construction,
suggested by the author,<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c003'><sup>[44]</sup></a> accords closely with that used by Mr. Alvord
and the writer in a recent valuation of a large water-works property,
in which the "interest-during-construction" charges were limited, and
the contributions to depreciation account were begun, at the date on
which any workable unit of the property was assumed to be available
for service and to begin to earn a return on its investment cost, even
though the structure, as a whole, was not assumed to be completed
for a considerable period of years thereafter. Thus, for instance, it
might be assumed that as soon as the supplying works in a water-works
project were in operation, the investment in them and in the distribution
pipe system laid up to that time, would cease to be credited
further with "interest-during-construction" allowances, and would be
compelled to earn interest through the water rates or income from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>water supplied to consumers—the fact that the interest charge could
not be wholly met, immediately at this time, being taken care of in the
resulting increment in going value.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such a theory, of course, does involve a determination of the
probable order and rapidity of construction of the component parts of
the property, and this is usually made, in water-works valuation, in the
estimate of the reproduction cost of the property.</p>

<p class='c000'>For the sake of completeness, in reference to the legal decisions
of importance in valuation proceedings, attention is called to the
Pennsylvania case, Brymer <em>vs.</em> Butler Water Company (179 Pa., 231),
referred to in the closing discussion on the writer's paper on "Water-Works
Valuation."<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c003'><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In this case Justice Williams, speaking for the Supreme Court of
Pennsylvania, says:</p>

<p class='c018'>"By what rule is the Court to determine what is reasonable and
what is oppressive? Ordinarily, that is a reasonable charge or system
of charges which yields a fair return upon the investment. Fixed
charges and costs of maintenance and operation must first be provided
for. Then the interests of the owners of the property are to be considered.
They are entitled to a rate of return, if their property will
earn it, not less than the legal rate of interest; and a system of
charges that yields no more income than is fairly required to maintain
the plant, pay fixed charges and operating expenses, provide a suitable
sinking fund for the payment of debts, and pay a fair profit to the
owners of the property cannot be said to be unreasonable."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Pennsylvania Court, therefore, in the words of William S.
Wallace, Esq., recognizes the single standard:</p>

<p class='c018'>"The Single Standard, according to the Brymer case, while acknowledging
the full right of the public to regulate such public corporations,
also recognizes as a prime factor its private character and the rights
which accrue to it in that capacity, ... and holds to what seems
to me the only rational and practicable basis, that a fair return, after
deducting the charges above enumerated, <em>is</em> a reasonable rate";
whereas, "the Double Standard basis of fixing a reasonable rate seems
to accentuate the public side of the corporation and rather ignores the
private element."</p>

<p class='c000'>As to the propriety of the inclusion of a substantial recognition of
franchise value as a basis for rating, the layman may well confess
to perplexity, in the light of the conflicting nature of the two important
recent United States Supreme Court opinions referred to—the Knoxville
case, and the Consolidated Gas Company case—for, while substantial
allowance was made for franchise value, in the Consolidated
Gas Company case decision, in large measure apparently on account
of its earlier recognition by the legislature, in the Knoxville case, in
spite of legislative recognition of such value, and similar approval of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>the issue of securities predicated on such recognition, the United
States Supreme Court failed to make similar allowance for franchise
value.</p>

<p class='c000'>The author's treatment of the unit price question and the contingency
item is intelligent and creditable. Engineers are prone to
make valuations based on "hindsight" instead of "foresight," on the
assumption that no substantial difficulties in construction were encountered,
when, in fact, substantial difficulties should perhaps have
been anticipated, and may actually have been encountered in the
original construction, record of them having been obliterated, however,
with the lapse of time.</p>

<p class='c000'>The author's definition of the value of a property, as the "estimated
worth at a given time, measured in money, taking into account all
the elements which add to its usefulness or desirability as a business
or profit-earning proposition," suggests the advisability of recognizing
the other side of the ledger by modifying his statement so as to read:
"* * * all the elements which add to, 'limit, or detract from' its
usefulness or desirability as a business or profit-earning proposition."</p>

<p class='c000'>While recognizing the author's view, that there is no separate and
independent method of determining franchise value, which is not
based on the determination of the value of the property as a whole,
by capitalization methods, it must be recognized that going value may
be determined independently, and may have a positive value, even
though the property as a commercial whole is worth less than the sum
of the physical value and the going value.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Court, appraisers, and the author, alike recognize that there
is no one method of valuation of universal application. First cost,
reproduction cost, reproduction cost less depreciation, commercial value
determined by capitalization, worth of the service to the consumer,
and market price of the property, if such exists, all have their weight,
in varying degree in different cases. Whatever may be said of, for, or
against, these several methods of valuation, relates rather to their significance,
and the weight which should attach to the results obtained
by them, as evidence of value and of the effect of the modifying local
conditions, than to the soundness of the methods themselves.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this connection it may be of interest to refer to a recent valuation
of a water-works property, in the appraisal of which the writer
chanced to participate, in which there was finally placed before the
board of appraisal a summing up of:</p>

<p class='c029'>1. The original cost;</p>

<p class='c029'>2. Reproduction cost less accrued depreciation, plus going value;</p>

<p class='c029'>3. The worth of the service to the consumers, based on a stated
assumption of reasonable increment in value in excess of
actual cost, upon which a return (or interest and profit)
should be earned;</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>4. The commercial or capitalized value, on certain assumptions
based on present conditions, and also on possible future conditions
which might be involved in a renewal of the City contract,
which was to expire within two years.</p>

<p class='c000'>That these determinations of value, from different points of view,
had an influence in moulding the opinion of the individual appraisers,
there can be little doubt; yet it is probably equally true that in no case
was like weight attached to the several items or bases of valuation.
Nevertheless, in the final valuation, the consensus of opinion as to the
value of the property, as a whole, was remarkably close, the extreme
variations in opinion being approximately 8%, more, or less, than the
final appraised valuation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Attention should also be called to the necessity, in any valuation
by capitalization of income, such as that outlined by Mr. Riggs and
used by Professor Adams in the U. S. Government Valuation of Railroads,<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c003'><sup>[46]</sup></a>
of determining whether the plant or property is in what might
be termed an over-built, normally developed, or under-built condition;
in short, whether the investing public has correctly gauged its momentary
physical condition with reference to its bearing on the rates, and
whether the earnings are in fact inadequate, commensurate with the
service rendered, or excessive. In the long run, due weight will be
given to these facts; in a brief period, they may be incorrectly gauged.
In water-works properties, unfortunately, there is rarely, if ever, a
market price of the securities which can be said to be credible or
significant in valuation. Therefore, in the valuation of water-works
properties, it is the more important that the appraisers should weigh
carefully the present character of the service furnished and the momentary
adequacy or inadequacy of the rates as predicated on such service,
on the needs of the community, and the existing standards of the day,
if full justice is to be done.</p>

<p class='c000'>In conclusion, the writer reiterates his statement, that he has taken
issue with the author in no carping spirit of criticism, but with a
recognition of the difficulty and complexity of the work of appraisal,
and the conviction that engineers are under a moral obligation to do
an educational work in pointedly calling attention to the fact that the
going, or going concern, value, of a public service corporation's property
is not an intangible value representing an unearned increment,
but a very real and substantial item of cost in the property as a whole.
While the difficulty may be met by placing going value, as suggested
by the writer, in a middle class between physical plant and intangible
values, the placing of it in the same class with franchise and other
intangible elements of value, as suggested by the author, may, in the
judgment of the writer, do a serious injury to corporations, in failing
to give expression, in such a manner as shall be clearly within the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>grasp of the popular mind, to the fundamental idea of the cost of
developing going value. While the writer has no personal interest in
the matter, on one side or the other, having served both municipality
and corporation in water-works valuations, he feels, nevertheless, that
engineers can do a genuine service, alike to the public and to the public
service corporation, in laying stress on the fundamental elements of
cost and value, and particularly those on which rates should be predicated,
in public service corporation property valuation and rating.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Charles Hansel, M. Am. Soc. C. E.</span>—So much has been said on
the subject of valuation of public utilities that, although the speaker
has thought on the subject for ten years, and has done considerable
valuation of railroad properties, he finds that he is considerably confused,
for the reason that the discussions seem to cover the whole field
of engineering, accounting, taxation, and economics; therefore he
suggests that, in order to get down to a basis of usefulness, a special
committee should be appointed to take this question under consideration.</p>

<p class='c000'>The speaker had the honor of being associated with the Michigan
Commission, as a member of the Board of Review. Professor M. E.
Cooley was selected by the State of Michigan to take charge of the
work of organization, and Mr. Riggs was the engineer who organized
the office and field forces. Both these gentlemen were eminently successful
in that very difficult work. Mr. Cooley did this Board the
honor of saying that there were so many problems coming up in
actually carrying out the work (aside from the theories of taxation,
rate-making, accounting, and several other things, which could be found
more readily in the Auditor's office than in the Engineer's), that he
had asked for the appointment of this Board of Review, to sit as a
Court, and to pass on the many complex questions arising from day
to day; and he had the satisfaction of coming to the Board every day
and saying: "Well, now here is a condition, and how will I handle it?"
Of course, actually, he knew more about it than the Board, but he
was kind enough to say that he would ask for the Board's opinion.
That Board adjudicated all these various questions to the best of its
ability, and the speaker has the satisfaction of knowing that the
valuation has stood in the Federal Courts. The subjects are so
fugitive and so illusive that very much depends on the point of view.</p>

<p class='c000'>The speaker is now engaged in the actual task of trying to place a
valuation on some $300,000,000 worth of property in New Jersey,
involving the most important terminals in the United States.</p>

<p class='c000'>The valuation of public service utilities is the most profound question
which has ever been before the Society, and it includes a great
deal which is outside of strictly engineering questions; in fact, the discussions
do not throw much light on the methods which should be
followed in making valuations.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>The terminology of a subject is very important; in fact, the speaker
has found it so important that in his discussions with the Attorney-General
of New Jersey, in reference to the Railroad Tax Law, which
he has been asked to re-draft, that draft will be accompanied by a
glossary, so that the meaning of certain terms used in that particular
Act will be clear.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this New Jersey work some eighty-seven engineers and assistants
are employed, and for their guidance the speaker has prepared thirty-five
pages of very carefully considered instructions. These instructions
are accompanied by blue prints showing exactly how all field notes must
be recorded, with diagrams of trusses, culverts, and the like, and all the
elements of railroad construction.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Tax Law of New Jersey states that, first, the true value of the
real estate shall be ascertained; second, the true value of the tangible
personal property; and the first law of 1884 stated: "and third, the
value of the franchise"; but somebody discovered that there was something
besides the value of the real estate, the tangible personal property,
and the franchise. They did not know what it was, but there was
something else; therefore, in the 1888 law they changed the third
division of value to read: "the remaining property, including the
franchise."</p>

<p class='c000'>As an example of one of the difficulties of determining classification,
attention is directed to the term, Real Estate, which is broadly,
but seldom accurately, understood.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Interstate Commerce Commission is the highest tribunal in the
land, in the matter of railroad accounting, but it affords no help in
many important elements of value; for instance, under the Interstate
Commerce Commission, real estate includes only such real estate (land)
as is not required for railroad purposes. All land actually used for
railroad purposes is classified under "Right of Way and Station
Grounds."</p>

<p class='c000'>When the engineers on the New Jersey valuation were sent into
the field, it was necessary to specify exactly what elements must be
described as real estate, and what as tangible personal property. The
division line had to be defined accurately for the reason that all
personal property is assessed permanently to the State, while, in the
case of real estate, the State receives the taxes on a strip not exceeding
100 ft. in width, and the tax on all property used for railroad purposes
outside this strip reverts to the taxing district wherein it is found.</p>

<p class='c000'>The vexatious question as to whether machinery is to be considered
as real estate or personal property was settled by the New Jersey Law,
which says that tangible personal property shall include all machinery;
but it left unsettled the question: what is machinery? After careful
consideration, real estate was divided into 74 classes, and all other tangible
elements were classified as personal property. Some of the items of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>real estate are: ash-handling machinery and the like, chimneys, cisterns,
conveyors, dams, locks, lock machinery, electric wiring, piping,
heating, interlocking, signaling, pavements, reservoirs, shop fittings,
tanks, telegraph lines, track, track scales, transfer tables, water-works,
etc., etc.  Generally speaking, all items of a fixed character were
included in the 74 divisions of real estate.</p>

<p class='c000'>The difficulties of determining all the elements of real estate are
mentioned simply to call attention to what at first glance seems quite
simple, but on close examination is found to have great complexities.</p>

<p class='c000'>The question of useful life depreciation, direct and indirect, due
to decrepitude or obsolescence, or both, is one of the illusive questions;
and then comes the value of the franchise.</p>

<p class='c000'>The valuation of railroad property in New Jersey is further complicated
by the requirements of the State Tax Law, which specifies that
the value of the remaining property, including the franchise, shall
be determined after the "true value" of the real estate and tangible
personal property have been determined.</p>

<p class='c000'>The speaker will not attempt a discussion of franchise values, as
it is a subject which requires the most profound study.</p>

<p class='c000'>The author states that he is appalled at the speaker's misconception
of the method of determining non-physical value used by Professor
Adams in Michigan. The speaker is perfectly familiar with that
method, and, although having the greatest respect for Professor
Adams' opinions, is compelled to draw attention to two important
elements of that formula which are open to objection.</p>

<p class='c000'>Professor Adams establishes his annuity on the depreciated value,
rather than on the cost, or the reproduction cost, which, in the speaker's
opinion, does not determine the proper annuity or reasonable fixed
charges to be deducted from net income before net surplus is established.
Bonds are generally sold at a considerable discount, and
represent the full cost plus this discount, consequently, the interest
on bonds or fixed charges will be greater than an annuity established
on cost, "reproduction cost," or "present value." Would it not more
nearly establish fixed charges or annuity, to take the cost plus discount
and commissions as the basis on which to apply the annuity rate?</p>

<p class='c000'>While Professor Adams' formula establishes a larger net surplus
for capitalization than the method suggested by the speaker, he in
effect destroys this net surplus by charging against it all betterments
chargeable to income. It is quite clear that this gives the railroad
company a chance to absorb all net income into betterments, and thus
wipe out all net income, in which case there would be no net surplus
to capitalize, consequently, no non-physical or franchise value, and the
total value established under this plan would be less than if the
property had not been improved by the betterments—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">reductio ad
absurdum</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>In reference to the question of whether or not the method of valuation
should be the same, regardless of the purpose to which the value is
to be applied, the speaker cannot agree with the author, and believes
that it is quite consistent to establish different values for different
purposes.</p>

<p class='c000'>The completion of a large public utility, planned on such a scale
as to provide for the requirements of many years to come, utilizing
but part of its capacity, and earning less than its operating expenses
and fixed charges, with its rates of toll fixed by law, must be considered
in a different way than a well-established public utility, with business
forcing it to its utmost capacity, and with tolls not fixed by law.
There are many important elements bearing on this consideration of
value, and the purpose of the valuation should be known before attempting
to establish the value.</p>

<p class='c000'>In New Jersey the work is complicated further by the necessity of
establishing the value of 122 separate railroad corporations, and the
assignment of all property outside the 100-ft. strip to each of the
450 taxing districts through which the 122 corporations, with their
many branches and spurs, are operating.</p>

<p class='c000'>In order to determine the quantities and materials in the permanent
way and structures, nine engineer corps were organized, each
corp consisting of six men. With this force the center line of the
main running track was measured, and the exact distance in each
taxing district recorded. Cross-sections of the roadbed were made
as often as changes in the natural surface required, and accurate
measurements and notes were made of all structures; and, although
in many cases the engineers were able to secure the plans of the more
important steel structures, the field parties were required to obtain
sufficient data to compute the tonnage in case it was impossible to get
these plans.</p>

<p class='c000'>The field parties were also instructed to note the character of the
land and improvements adjoining railroad property, and record such
other information as was necessary for a comprehensive understanding of
the conditions attendant on the construction of a railroad in that locality.</p>

<p class='c000'>The time allotted for the completion of the work is one year, and
although this is a comparatively short period in which to introduce
a premium system in field work, it was decided to inaugurate such a
system as would be as nearly satisfactory as possible under the conditions.
A record of each field force for each day in each month was
made on profile paper, using the horizontal lines to represent the
number of tracks, and the vertical lines to represent distance. Two
horizontal lines were allowed for single track, four for double track,
and so on. One mile was allowed for each vertical division of the
paper, and, in awarding the premium, there was taken into consideration,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>not only the extent of territory covered by each field party, but
much consideration was given to the field notes, and a cash prize was
awarded each month.</p>

<p class='c000'>The results of the organization and encouragement to the field
parties are shown by the very great increase in the amount of work
per man of the field parties, which was nearly 300% during the time
the parties were in the field.</p>

<p class='c000'>A great many questions hinging on interstate commerce, and
involving Fundamental, State, Federal, and International Law, are
embraced in the broad view of the valuation of railroad properties.
The movement of rolling stock through various States, and between
the United States, Canada, and Mexico, and the determination of the
situs and domicile of floating equipment, are subjects which, not only
require considerable knowledge of railroad operation, but involve many
questions not clearly determined by the Courts.</p>

<p class='c000'>The subject is of such great importance that steps should be taken
to formulate methods of procedure, and, at the Annual Meeting of the
Society, the speaker will offer a resolution requesting the appointment
of a Special Committee to determine the proper methods to be used
in the valuation of public utilities.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>J. Martin Schreiber, M. Am. Soc. C. E.</span>—Engineers and those
generally interested in the valuation of public service properties are
fortunate in having the valuable information embodied in this paper.
Although there are some points on which the speaker differs with the
author, the following remarks are only offered in order to bring out,
from experience, some further phases of the subject, rather than as an
attempt to criticize.</p>

<p class='c000'>A great deal is heard about the exact cost of reproduction, also
arguments in reference to the proper allowance for contingencies,
probably only involving a small percentage. The speaker questions
the propriety of advocating the exact cost figures. The carefully
checked cost figures of reliable contractors, with first-class engineering
organizations, submitting proposals on the same construction, are
often found to vary from 5 to 15% from the total cost. Different
organizations will sometimes be the cause of figures varying 5% or
more, depending on the efficiency and experience of the corps. A clever
purchasing agent will reduce an apparently precise estimate on equipment
or supplies as much as 10%; on the other hand, the condition
of the market may be such that the actual price paid exceeds the
estimate by the same percentage. Engineers who are responsible for
estimating on, and the execution of, construction projects generally
add more than 10% for contingencies, as it is practically impossible to
anticipate them, and a precise estimate is almost certain to fall short.
It is unfortunate that it is almost impossible to sustain contingency
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>figures on the witness stand; for that reason, probably, it would be more
satisfactory to the lay mind, and to the various courts, boards, etc.,
which are required to pass on valuations, and do not thoroughly understand
the technicalities of the situation, if engineers would drop the
contingency item and modify the quantities or the unit prices.</p>

<p class='c000'>If it is possible to estimate the exact cost of reproduction, certainly
considerable variation may be expected from independent sources in
computing depreciation and present values. Yet there are reputable
engineers who would have one believe (assuming that they know the
cost of reproduction) that by a simple field inspection they are able to
compute the exact present value.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some time ago, the speaker heard an expert testify in the interest
of a certain city, for tax purposes, with reference to the value of a piece
of street-railway track. He first stated the valuation for reproduction,
and then the definite present value. The latter was greatly in excess
of the actual value. The expert, who was an engineer of considerable
standing, on cross-examination, did not know the height of rail from
top of head to bottom of groove, either at the joint or any other part in
its length; he did not know the exact depth of flange of the car wheels
which operated over that track, the headway, or the exact weight of
the cars used. He had assumed the condition of the ties, and that the
track was ballasted. Finally, he was compelled to admit that his
determination of the depreciation, by simply a field inspection, was a
very rough approximation. Now, it is not in every case in the past
that a corporation attorney, even with engineering assistance, has been
able to point out unfair testimony. Many times the speaker has heard
incompetent testimony admitted, on the general principle that the
witness was an engineer of note, even though his record had been
made in other specialities. Too much stress cannot be put on this phase
of the subject, and the speaker is glad that the author has mentioned
the fact that the personnel of those doing appraisal work should be of
the highest order. In the past it is probable that the failure to discriminate
properly in accepting incompetent testimony (not to mention
prejudiced testimony) was automatic, and this is the most important
reason for much of the hostility of officials of public service properties
toward all forms of investigation, as the author mentions.</p>

<p class='c000'>Company officials know that they are often compelled to employ
and train specialists to furnish, within fairly accurate limits, the very
information which is being sought, and naturally they are skeptical
about the data presented by those who, though not intimate with the
property, purport to give exact cost figures. Any one who is able to
point out a consistent method whereby these exact figures may be
obtained surely will obtain credit for a valuable contribution toward
the solution of the complex subject of valuation.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>Referring to the valuation of the property of the Detroit United
Railroads, mentioned in the paper, the Director of Appraisals for the
city estimated that the cost of the complete appraisal of the property,
which includes about 220 miles of single track, would be from $3,000 to
$4,000. Approximately, $25,000 has already been spent, not including
the expense sustained by the company, which furnished a large proportion
of the information.</p>

<p class='c000'>Probably correct present value estimates which include depreciation
may not be even fairly approximated without intimate knowledge
of the particular property, and this should embody operation, policy of
management, past performance, study of historical cost (as far as the
records will permit), estimated cost of construction, and actual cost of
maintenance. The life of a piece of track or equipment, disregarding
obsolescence and extraordinaries, generally depends on the type and
details of construction, the service it has done, and the service that will
be required of it. Renewals should be made when the cost of repairs
reaches a certain figure, other conditions being favorable. It is a fact
that able engineers, intimately acquainted with the case at issue, and
employed on the same property, often have conflicting ideas in reference
to the life of track or equipment, one recommending immediate renewal
and another advocating longer operation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The speaker does not intend to argue against the possibility of
placing fairly accurate values on reproduction or present value, but
wishes to bring out the fact that it is not as simple as the lay mind
is often led to believe. Further than that, he is of the opinion that the
following is essential for economical and satisfactory valuations for all
concerned:</p>

<p class='c000'>(1) There should be co-operation of the appraisers with the public
service property officials, including operators, engineers, and their
records.</p>

<p class='c000'>(2) Present values should be determined by:</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>a</em>) Cost of reproduction,</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>b</em>) Mortality tables,</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>c</em>) Data of performance,</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>d</em>) Field examination.</p>

<p class='c000'>(3) The organization for the appraisal work should be of sufficient
scope, and should be allowed the time and funds which the project
reasonably requires.</p>

<p class='c000'>(4) The appraisers should be carefully selected, the personnel
including men who have had wide experience in the particular class
of operation; and specialists should be obtained if necessary.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Riggs states that the valuation should be the same, regardless of
the principles at issue. It seems questionable to consider the fair value
which involves the non-physical value in costs or tax regulations.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>Certainly, in the case of street railways in cities, where a percentage
is levied on the gross receipts, the non-physical valuation, only representing
present value, is necessary. Again, a physical present value for
taxation should not include the value of paving in the street in the
strip occupied by street-railway tracks. That the street-railway company
often pays an arbitrary assessment tax and keeps the paving in
repair, though it is in no way responsible for the wear, should be sufficient
to offset any obligation for other taxes. In some States this is
fixed by the Courts. The physical valuation, however, intended to be
used in connection with rates, cost, or capital regulation, should include
the cost of paving the railway strip. Referring further to the question
of including the paving in the physical valuation of street railways,
in the case of a decision of R. W. Tayler, Arbitrator, in the proceedings
between the Cleveland Electric Railway Company and the City of
Cleveland, on a basis of a renewal of franchises, Judge Tayler said:</p>

<p class='c018'>"Paving represents actual money expended. It belongs to capital
account, and in its depreciated form is worth all the allowance that I
have given it."</p>

<p class='c000'>Also for rate-making and the capital regulation some consideration
is certainly due to obsolescence and change of art, while in taxation
they should not be included.</p>

<p class='c000'>In conclusion, the speaker is optimistic enough to believe that the
problem of physical valuations will be solved satisfactorily for all concerned.
Co-operation of officials of the public service properties,
reliable testimony, with a better understanding by the Courts, will
certainly tend to clarify the situation. Non-physical values are very
difficult to determine, and their intelligent treatment will require some
well-defined procedure. Mr. Riggs' valuable paper will go a great way
toward producing a correct idea of the general proportion, and will, no
doubt, assist in the formulation of proper methods for valuation.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Clinton S. Burns, M. Am. Soc. C. E.</span> (by letter).—The author is
to be congratulated on the detailed care shown in the presentation of
this subject. Perhaps few engineers who have not been called on to
cope with the subject of valuation of properties, realize or appreciate
the real complexity of the many varied problems encountered in work
of this class. To those who are engaged directly in appraisement work,
this paper will be a welcome contribution to the literature on the
subject.</p>

<p class='c000'>The author's statement that if a commission of engineers is directed
to report the true cost of reproduction, depreciation, or present value
of a certain property, the final figures should not differ, whether the
report is to be used as a basis for reorganization, sale, rate purposes,
or taxation, is open to argument. It seems proper that, if a property
is appraised in order to fix a selling price to a Government or municipality
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>exercising its right to purchase, the final figures should be
based on current prices of labor and material, because this does no
injustice to either party. It is evident that if the seller secures payment
for his property based on current prices, he may, if he desires,
reinvest the proceeds of the sale in similar enterprises at current
prices, so that thereby he secures the same benefits, whether prices are
high or low.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is equally evident that if the purchaser (the municipality)
chooses to purchase the property, the right to purchase must be
exercised at the particular time permitted by the franchise. If prices
chance to be abnormally high at that time, the municipality is exactly
on a par with what it would be if compelled to build its own plant
at that particular time; while, if prices be abnormally low, the same
relative situation still exists. There seems, therefore, to be no possible
injustice to either party in using current prices, when the object is a
sale or transfer of the property. However, in determining a proper
value as a basis of rates, another factor must be considered. It is
inexpedient and against public policy to make frequent changes in the
rate charged for such commodities as water, gas, or electric current.
Theoretically, the rate could be fixed each year, based on an annual
valuation of the property, thus permitting a high rate one year and
perhaps an abnormally low rate another year; but, practically, this
is impossible, for, aside from the inconvenience of such a cumbersome
system, no community is well enough informed as individuals to comprehend
any reason whatever for ever raising rates. Raising rates is
invariably accompanied by a wave of indignation. However, it is
apparent that a series of rates based on an annual current price valuation
of the property would average exactly the same, during a term
of years, as though the property were valued once for all on the basis
of the average prices of labor and material for the same term of
years, and the rate based on the one valuation thus determined.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the object of the valuation is to afford data for taxation, the
same argument applies as in a case of fixing rates. It thus seems
proper that the object of the appraisement should be taken into consideration
before it is determined whether to use average prices, or
current prices, of material and labor; and, if this is correct logic, the
final figures must differ according to the object in view; but, having
determined the proper unit prices to be used throughout any appraisement
as being the most equitable for the object in view, then, as the
author well says, the appraiser must not allow personal prejudices or
fancied conditions to influence his course. Above all, an appraiser
must not be afraid of his client. He must not allow his personal
judgment to be swerved by the latter's desires. It perhaps seldom if
ever occurs that an appraiser, representing a municipality, or State,
is subjected to this unconscious influence, inasmuch as his employer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>is merely a temporary public official, and consequently he has no
client to fear. He goes into the work with a full knowledge that his
employer knows little or nothing of the subject, and his only desire
is to reach results which will be unquestionably fair to both parties.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the other hand, the appraiser who is chosen by the owner of a
plant takes hold of the work with a feeling that he is expected to
report a value as favorable as possible to his client, and this feeling
is reflected in the report, regardless of how sincerely or conscientiously
he tries to avoid it.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the most intricate and yet interesting problems in appraisement
work is the computation of the "going value," or "business value"
which should be allowed in addition to the physical value.</p>

<p class='c000'>In considering a competitive enterprise, such as a railway serving a
community in competition with another independent railway, this
problem must be treated in a different way than in a non-competitive
business, such as a water-works, gas-works, electric plant, street
railway, or similar enterprise operating under the protection of an
exclusive franchise, or under natural conditions equivalent to an
exclusive privilege.</p>

<p class='c000'>In considering competitive enterprises, it is manifest that a railway
operating under conditions more advantageous than its competitor
possesses an intangible value equal to the measure of that advantage.
It is not clear, however, whether it is more proper to say that the
railway possessing the advantage has a positive going value, or whether
the less fortunate one has a negative going value. Using the rule
formulated by the author, being that of Professor Adams, with some
modifications, it is evident that many properties would show negative
going values; but, as pointed out by the author, the Courts hold that
public service corporations are entitled to earn:</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>a</em>) Operating expenses;</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>b</em>) Expenses of maintenance and running repair;</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>c</em>) Taxes;</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>d</em>) A sinking fund to cover depreciation and obsolescence;</p>

<p class='c005'>(<em>e</em>) A reasonable profit on the fair value of the property.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is improbable that a reasonable profit on the fair value of the
property could be construed to mean less than the interest or revenue
from a like amount of Government bonds or other non-taxable
securities.</p>

<p class='c000'>This ruling of the Courts fixes the rates at such a figure as to
preclude the possibility of a deficit; from which it must follow that a
negative going value cannot be created by a compulsory reduction in
rates, for such action would be confiscation of property to the extent
of the negative intangible value thus created; that is to say, if the
Courts are right in the above ruling, then all intangible or going values
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>are positive, and must be determined by using the most unfavorably
situated railway as the basis of computation in determining the question
of reasonableness of rates; and the rates in turn must be reasonable
and proper before they can be applied to determine the intangible
value. This raises an interesting and far-reaching query. Assume
that a negative going value is the result of real competition between
two roads such that the "fair value" of the less fortunate competitor
is 20% less than its physical value.</p>

<p class='c000'>If rates are based on this valuation, are they really fair rates?
For, suppose the rates had always been maintained at a point where
the less fortunate road could just support its physical valuation.
Clearly, no rate could then be enforced which would compel it to
operate for less than a reasonable profit on the fair value of its
property, and the fair value under this assumption is 25% greater
than before, due to no effort of its own, but simply to the fact that
its competitor has not cut rates, and has thereby preserved the original
"fair value" of the less fortunate road, and at the same time increased
its own positive going value by an equal amount.</p>

<p class='c000'>In view of this analysis it is doubtful if it is ever proper to consider
the existence of negative intangible values, although it is true
that the commercial value does fluctuate, and may be less than the
physical value, due to rates which are too low, perhaps, or due to other
temporary causes.</p>

<p class='c000'>The method quoted from Mr. Alvord for determining going value
applies to non-competitive enterprises only, as was stated by Mr. Alvord
in his paper before the American Water-Works Association. This
method is open to the criticism that the forecast of the business of the
older works, and of the new hypothetical works as well, is reduced to
a monetary value, based on the present rates, regardless of whether or
not such rates are reasonable. Rates are subject to legislative control
in many States, and there is absolutely no assurance that any other
State may not adopt legislation at any time permitting regulatory
ordinances to be enforced. Therefore, any forecast of the value of
future business must be based on reasonable rates, for otherwise it is
merely an unwarranted estimate based on a fond hope.</p>

<p class='c000'>Taking into consideration the fact that rates must be reasonable,
either by virtue of present laws or laws which may become effective
at any time, perhaps in the immediate future, going value may well
be defined as the present worth of the amount by which the anticipated
profits of a going plant, operating at reasonable rates, exceed the
present worth of the anticipated profits of a similar hypothetical starting
plant, operating at those same rates. With this conception of
going value, it is impossible for a non-competitive property to have a
negative going value, and every operating plant has a positive going
value, even though operating at a loss.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>The whole problem hinges on the question of "what is the reasonable
rate or proper return," and this should be determined in the
aggregate as the starting point. The Courts have persistently dodged
the issue, and properly so, whenever that question has arisen, leaving
it for consideration in each particular case, depending on the stability
of the business, the hazard involved, and various other local factors.</p>

<p class='c000'>It may safely be conceded that this fair profit is something in excess
of the return from Government bonds, and for the purpose of this
discussion it matters not what figure is assumed as the fair profit—whether
5, 6, or 10%, or what-not—the theory is the same in any case.
This is perhaps best explained by a practical illustration:</p>

<p class='c000'>Take, for example, a water-works system, the physical present
value of which has been determined by the method of reproduction to
be $1,000,000, and denote the going value by the unknown quantity, <i>x</i>;
suppose, further, that 6% is considered a reasonable return on the
"fair value"—not yet determined, the "fair value" being $1,000,000
plus the going value, <i>x</i>. Therefore, the rates must be such as to
produce in the aggregate an amount equal to the operating expenses,
maintenance, taxes, sinking fund, and depreciation, and still have a
profit of 6% on the fair value of the property. The anticipated profits
of the going plant, therefore, are exactly 6% of ($1,000,000 + <i>x</i>) =
$60,000 + 6<i>x</i>/100 per annum. The anticipated profits of the hypothetical
starting plant will be negative at the start, and gradually increase,
finally reaching a maximum of $60,000 + 6<i>x</i>/100 per annum.</p>

<p class='c000'>It must be remembered that, in estimating the operating expense
and income of the starting plant, as well as the going plant, the figures
must be confined rigidly to the plant as it is found at the date of
valuation, and in no case should any account be taken of income or
operating expenses due to probable future extensions of the distribution
system. Many appraisers overlook this point, and predicate the
anticipated profits of the going plant on the past growth of the income
account, forgetting that a considerable portion of this growth is due
to extensions into new territory, and not to any material increase in
revenue from the territory already served. To include income from
new territory in the forecast of income is just as fatal an error as to
include the anticipated expenditure of new capital in the present
physical valuation. Either of these procedures is really an estimate or
appraisement of some other plant, rather than the one actually under
consideration.</p>

<p class='c000'>To complete the numerical illustration, suppose it is determined
that the time required to construct the hypothetical starting plant is
3 years; that a portion of the plant is put into operation at the end
of the second year, taking over fire-hydrant rental equivalent to $20,000;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>that the revenue from private sources aggregates $20,000 during the
last year of construction; that the expenses of operation, maintenance,
taxes, and depreciation amount to $30,000 during this year. After the
time of completion of the plant has elapsed, it has the total credit for
fire-hydrant rental, and it is assumed that the revenue from private
sources and the cost of operation, maintenance, taxes, and depreciation
increase as shown in Table 14, which illustrates the method of computing
the going value, and gives the resulting value for the case just
stated.</p>

<p class='c000'>Therefore, 171,005 + 0.2597<i>x</i> = <i>x</i>; hence, <i>x</i> = $231,000. This
result is based on the assumption that the starting plant earned no
interest during the construction period. If an allowance for lost
interest during construction has been made and added to the capital
account already being included in the physical appraisement of
$1,000,000, then this must be charged back against the going value
found above. This is clearly evident, because the calculations to
determine going value date from the beginning of the construction
period, and the lost interest during construction, therefore, is provided
for in the result. Most appraisers allow an item for lost interest
amounting to the legal rate of interest running for half the construction
period, which, in the illustration under discussion, would be
$90,000; deducting this sum, if previously included, gives $141,000 as
the going value.</p>

<p class='c000'>There seems to be no good reason for allowing lost interest during
construction as an item in the physical valuation of a property, any
more than for allowing all of the lost interest, up to the time when
the property begins to yield a return equal to the rate of interest. It
is one of the problems in finance, and is much better treated as an
element in the going value, as shown in the above illustration.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the most difficult factors on which to agree in computations
of this nature is the element of time required for the hypothetical
starting plant to acquire the business. Were it not for this uncertainty,
going value could be computed with mathematical precision
by the method suggested.</p>

<p class='c000'>In determining the physical valuation on the basis of cost of reproduction,
such items as cost of taking up and replacing street paving
over the pipe lines, cost incurred by reason of sewers and drains
encountered, interference due to electric wires and conduits, interference
of traffic, and other metropolitan conditions which add greatly
to the cost of construction, must be allowed. Wherever such metropolitan
conditions exist, there must also be present a corresponding necessity
for the use of water under pressure. People use water because of
necessity or convenience, and not on account of any feeling of obligation
or loyalty to the water company.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>If highly developed metropolitan conditions are present, new business
will be acquired in the hypothetical starting plant much more
rapidly than where such conditions are yet to be developed. For this
reason the problem cannot be based on the early growth of the same
plant, and, there being no exact duplicate of conditions in existence
elsewhere, the estimate of time required for the business development
period is purely speculative, and must be assumed with great care and
judgment, else injustice may be done to one party or the other in the
resulting going value.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is interesting to note that, in the Michigan appraisal, the allowance
of a percentage for contingencies was bitterly contested by the
railroads as improper. Probably every appraiser who has been connected
with rate cases has seen this same item strenuously insisted on
by the corporations.</p>

<p class='c000'>The author's query: should a corporation which is compelled to
abandon appliances while yet serviceable, in response to public clamor,
be allowed any item of value in the appraisal on account of such
appliances, seems to be best answered in the negative. If the appraisal
is for the basis of making rates, the corporation is fully compensated
by the fact that its depreciation account provides for all abandoned
machinery, and the average past depreciation is usually considered a
fair criterion of the future. If the appraisal is for purposes of taxation,
it would seem improper to levy tax on abandoned or rejected
machinery or equipment. If the appraisal is to determine the present
value of a property for sale under condemnation proceedings, it is
likewise difficult to conceive any reason for allowing any present value
on account of property abandoned or rejected, and, indeed, if such
abandoned material had any value at the time of its removal, it is
more than likely that such value was converted into cash at that time.</p>

<p class='c000'>The statement that no appraiser would be justified in placing a
going concern value on a property 3 years old, or 10 years old, unless
the net earnings were such as to indicate that the property had a commercial
value in excess of the physical property, is questionable. "Commercial
value" is not exactly synonymous with "going concern value,"
for, as usually considered, the term "going concern value" represents the
difference between a dead structure and a live one. A property might
be compelled to operate temporarily at rates insufficient to return the
legal rate of interest on the physical value of the property, and while
this condition continued, its commercial value would be less than its
physical value, and yet this same property is worth more while running
than if operation ceased and the business was allowed to die.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Halbert P. Gilette, M. Am. Soc. C. E.</span> (by letter).—In common
with others who have written on the subject of appraisals, the author
omits consideration of one of the most important elements of the cost
of producing the property of a public service corporation, namely, the
development expense.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>Development expense is the deficit in "fair return" on the investment
during the early years of operation, while the business is being
developed to a point that will yield a "fair return" on the investment.
Unless this development expense is charged to the capital account as
fast as it occurs each year, it should draw compound interest up to
the end of the development period. Development expense might be
regarded as a part of the non-physical value of a plant, and a few
years ago the writer so regarded it. Latterly, however, he has come to
see that it does not differ one iota in principle from "interest during
construction," and, therefore, is properly a part of the cost of production
or of reproduction of the property. During the construction
period, interest on the investment is charged, and properly so, as a
part of the physical cost. Does this interest cease the day after operation
begins? Not a whit. The owners of the property are entitled
to a fair interest—a "fair return"—on their money, from the day it is
invested. At first they receive it in the form of "interest during construction,"
which is charged to capital account. After operation begins
they must either be allowed to earn more than a "fair return" during
the fat years following the development period, or the deficit below a
fair return incurred during the development period must be treated
exactly like "interest during construction" and added to the capital
account. If public service corporation managers have chosen the first
of these two methods, it does not relieve the appraiser of the duty of
adopting the second method; for the object of appraisals for rate-making
purposes is to limit capital to a "fair return" on the investment.
In brief, if there are to be no "fat years," then every "lean
year" must be credited with its deficit as fast as it occurs.</p>

<p class='c000'>This, the writer concedes, is a radical departure from such precedent
as already exists, but we must not overlook the fact that we of
to-day are establishing the precedents for appraisals in the future. The
whole matter of valuations for rate-making purposes is still in a
nebulous form, as far as the public, and indeed, as far as the Courts,
are concerned. In the end it will devolve upon engineers to establish
logical methods of appraisal. To do so, they must be able to look on
the problem both as engineers and as jurists. Up to the present, however,
this broadness of vision has not characterized most engineering
appraisers, nor is it to be wondered at when the Courts themselves are
in a maze.</p>

<p class='c000'>A great deal has been heard lately about "going concern value."
Ultimately, the Courts will hold that, as far as rate-making is concerned,
there is no such thing as "going concern value" in the present
meaning of the term. "Going concern value," in the final analysis,
consists of two elements: First, development expense (as previously
defined), and, second, capitalized surplus earnings. Surplus earnings
are ascertained by deducting from net earnings both taxes and a low
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>rate of interest on the investment, equivalent to interest on bonds.
Many factors may affect surplus earnings; but, that "going concern
value" consists largely of capitalized surplus earnings, cannot be denied.
What are surplus earnings? The public replies that they are mainly the
result of extortionate charges. This is doubtless correct in many cases;
hence, any investigation of costs which has for its object rate-making
must inevitably lead to repudiation of that part of "going concern
value" which is based on surplus earnings, if the surplus is at all large.
In a word, we reason in a circle if we capitalize surplus earnings,
calling the result "going concern value," and then undertake to use
"going concern value" as one of the factors in judging the fairness of
rates. To express the problem mathematically, we cannot solve for
a variable when the variable is allowed to exist on both sides of the
equation. Yet that is precisely what some rate-making bodies are
trying to do, and it is precisely what the Courts have often attempted
to do.</p>

<p class='c000'>To escape this confusion there is but one possible step, and that is
to eliminate "going concern value" entirely. We must first determine
the element of cost, which the writer terms development expense, and
we must regard this item as a part of the cost of reproduction. We
must next cease to consider small rates of interest as being a "fair
return" on this cost of reproduction. When first-class mortgages draw
5%, it is folly to talk of 6% as being a "fair return" on capital invested
in a business enterprise, especially when this 6% is figured on the actual
cost of reproduction of the property. It may be that 7% is an ample
"fair return" in some cases, but in others 10% will be found none too
much, considering the small size of the business and the risks involved.</p>

<p class='c000'>The writer will not at this time discuss methods of determining
how a "fair return" should be estimated, but, in general, the process
should be as follows: From the gross earnings deduct the operating
expenses and taxes to obtain the net earnings. From the net earnings
deduct a small rate of interest (equivalent to interest on bonds) on
the cost of reproduction. The remainder is profit, and should be expressed
as a percentage of the gross earnings. This percentage of
profit can then be compared with similar percentages made by merchants,
manufacturers, farmers, and other capitalists, and then it can
be determined logically by comparison whether or not the profit made
by a public service corporation is "fair." We must adopt this method
of attacking the problem or we shall inevitably drive capital away
from railway and other fields of public enterprise.</p>

<p class='c000'>The writer estimates roughly that a profit of 10% on gross earnings,
as above deduced, is about the same as a direct return of 7% on
the cost of reproducing the average steam railway.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a recent appraisal of a street-railway system, the writer
determined the actual development expense of the property, deducing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>it from the accounting records. It was an astonishingly high sum,
even assuming only 7% on the cost of reproduction as being a "fair
return." During his appraisal of all the railways in the State of
Washington, for the Railroad Commission, the writer made a similar
study of development expense, but this was not included in his estimate
of the cost of reproduction, as it was then regarded as being a part
of the "going concern value" and he was not commissioned to ascertain
the "going concern value" of the railways. Not a single railway, as
far as he knows, has ever presented to a State Railway Commission,
or to the Interstate Commerce Commission, an estimate of its development
expense along the lines indicated. Instead, the railway companies
have talked in general terms of long construction periods—often claiming
20 years or more—and of great expense incurred in building up
the business, and of franchise value, and of a score or more of non-provable
costs. The consequence is that they have frequently lost
entirely the one great item that they are clearly entitled to, namely
development expense, which is an item which can be absolutely proved
from their accounting records, and, therefore, rests not on the "hot
air" testimony of experts, but on facts that are incontrovertible. In
like manner, other public service corporations have often signally failed
to prove the full worth of their properties, because their claims for
"going concern value" have been ignored entirely. When a franchise
expires, the "going concern value" is usually looked on by the public
as worthless, nor is this view to be wondered at.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Riggs proposes adding to the physical value a minus "going
concern value," and he is logical in doing so, if it is conceded that
values for rate-making rest on profits; but this the writer does not
concede for an instant. Values for rate-making cannot rest on the
very thing that it is aimed to regulate, to wit, the rates charged.
Until engineers and public service commissions and Courts free themselves
from this confusion of cause and effect, there can be no rational
theory of rate-making.</p>

<p class='c000'>Values for rate-making must rest primarily either on the actual
costs of the production of a property or on estimated costs of reproduction,
including therein both interest charges during construction and
the sequel thereto—development expense.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of almost as great moment as the item of development expense is the
question of depreciation. The author, in common with most engineers,
holds that depreciation should be deducted. This is a consequence of regarding
a public service plant as if it were a machine bought in a second-hand
store. A public service plant is a device which is intended to
perform a given service forever. It is true that its parts are subject to
wear, and must be renewed from time to time; but the plant as a whole
is everlasting, or practically so. Managers of public service corporations,
perceiving this fundamental truth, have rarely established sinking funds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>for the redemption of any considerable part of the plant. In a great railway
system the renewal of a freight car is not a proportionately larger
item of expense than is the renewal of a tooth in a steam shovel
bucket owned by a contractor. This fact, coupled with the permanence
of the railway plant as a whole, has led railway owners to make no
provision for a return of the money lost in depreciation. Railway
ties in a large railway system inevitably reach a condition such that
their average age is exactly half the life of the average tie. Shall
a sinking fund be provided for ties? If not, where does logic place a
line of demarcation? When does an element of the railway plant
attain a condition of sufficient importance to warrant "writing off"
some of its value from the capital account? The facts are that railway
managers have not "written off" anything worthy of mention for
depreciation, and, in the writer's opinion, they have been perfectly
logical. Consequently, the operating expenses have been much less
than they would have been during the early years, had a sum been
placed annually in a sinking fund. Therefore, the development expense,
as deduced from the accounting records, is less than it would be if a
sinking fund were provided; and the amount of this difference is
precisely the amount of the depreciation. In other words, if depreciation
is to be deducted from the cost of reproduction, it must be added
to the development expense ascertained from the accounting records;
so that, in the final analysis, depreciation should be ignored entirely
in any appraisal of a public service corporation where the object is
either rate-making or purchase of the corporation by the public. One
qualification to this statement is needed, however, and that is that
the depreciation shall not have gone far enough to result in an average
age of plant less than half the life of the plant—that being the ultimate
normal operating condition.</p>

<p class='c000'>Engineers have a duty to perform, in making an appraisal of the
sort under consideration, which is judicial in its character and should
not savor in the least of the pawnshop. The engineer engaged by a
public service commission should not for an instant make it his object
to "beat down the price," no matter by what far-fetched theory he may
effect the result. Nor are engineers inclined to do this, except when
they regard themselves merely as agents of the public by whom they
are employed. Unfortunately, many appraisers have as yet failed to
realize that there is a vital distinction between the dealings that should
exist in public affairs and those that actually exist in private matters
involving the purchase and sale of property. In the latter case, the
buyer usually takes every possible advantage of the helplessness of the
seller. Is the seller ignorant? See that he remains so. Is the seller
hard-pushed for money? Grind down the price accordingly. Does
the seller offer goods which are a bit shop-worn? Dwell on that fact,
to the exclusion of all else. Such are the tradesman's arts, and such,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>the writer fears, have been the arts of some appraisers of public service
property.</p>

<p class='c000'>The writer believes that, under one form of agreement or another,
nearly every kind of public service can be more economically
and better performed by a public service corporation than by the public
itself through employees directly hired. But if America is not to pass
speedily into Government ownership and operation of all public
utilities, there must be a pronounced change of attitude on the part of
the public toward capital now invested in public service corporations.
Even as engineers, we are apt to be unconsciously influenced in our
attitude toward public service corporations, not only because of the
present public attitude, but because we are often put to great inconvenience
by the ill-considered resistance of the corporations whose
property we are called on to appraise for the public. Our duty plainly
consists, first, in regarding a public service corporation as a public
agent, and, second, in allotting such values that this public agent will
receive a full and fair return for every dollar judiciously and honestly
spent in building and developing its property. In carrying out this
plan, the writer finds it wise to study the entire financial history of a
corporation, going carefully through both the construction accounts
and the operating accounts from the beginning.</p>

<p class='c000'>The desirability of analyzing the actual costs of construction, betterment,
and operation of public service corporations, preparatory to
estimating the cost of reproduction, cannot be too strongly urged upon
appraisers. Unfortunately, many corporations refuse access to their
records, or claim that the records are too incomplete to be of value.
However, when they realize that from those very records can be
deduced one of the largest items of cost of reproduction, namely, the
item of development expense, they are certain to show as much willingness
as they now show aversion to disclosing their records.</p>

<p class='c000'>The writer has recently completed an appraisal of a street railway
system, the managers of which placed at his disposal the entire accounting
and engineering records. From these the development expense was
deduced, and forms an item which can be demonstrated in Court, if
need be, instead of being the subject of unsupported "expert testimony."
As far as the writer knows, this is the first time that a street railway
corporation has voluntarily opened all its books for use in an appraisal
which may be made public. May it not be one of the harbingers of a
far-sighted action on the part of public service corporations, which will
result eventually in eliminating entirely the hostile attitude of the
public toward its accredited agents?</p>

<p class='c000'>Reverting again, and finally, to the question of development expense,
it will be seen, after study, that the method of deducing it from the
accounting records provides for every possible item. The cost of
advertising, the cost of colonization, and canvassing by agents engaged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>in building up the business tributary to the corporation, the cost of
developing an efficient business organization and an efficient plant—every
possible item of developing the business finds accurate record in
the development expense deduced from the accounting records as outlined.
This may not be apparent at first glance, but a little consideration
proves it to be so. If, for example, $20,000 has been spent annually
for ten years in advertising to secure business, the operating expenses
have been increased exactly $20,000 for each of the ten years. Consequently,
the annual deficit below a "fair return" on the investment
has been made $20,000 greater each year than it would have been had
no expense for advertising been incurred. In other words, the deficit
below a "fair return," which is the development expense, shows automatically
the amount spent for every such item as advertising. The
writer regards this automatic register of development expenses as
being one of the most important features of his method for determining
such expense. It removes the entire problem from the realm of guess-work
and expert testimony, and makes it a problem in engineering
economics. It involves no question as to whether or not the existing
rates charged for freight, or for any other service, are fair.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Arthur L. Adams, M. Am. Soc. C. E.</span> (by letter).—This paper, in
spirit, diction, and contents, is a masterly presentation of the best
thought and argument, by engineer specialists and the higher Courts,
concerning this difficult subject—a presentation which only one intimately
associated with the question for years, as has been the author,
could hope to make. It is of special interest, too, because it deals
fundamentally with the Michigan railroad valuation, now ten years
old, and deservedly considered somewhat ancient in the evolution of
what may be termed the logic of valuation methods. The frank
acknowledgment of the now apparent deficiencies or errors of that work,
notably in the defective method and resulting under-valuation of real
estate, as well as the upholding of that which still appears to the
author to be sound in principle, are excellent manifestations of the
constructive and judicial spirit so necessary to the making of any
substantial contribution to the art.</p>

<p class='c000'>Unanimity of opinion in matters of detail, even among those
specializing in this line of practice, cannot be expected, especially in
a general discussion. Details must receive their emphasis from local
coloring and local conditions. Making allowance for these local conditions
in Michigan and other contiguous States—notably conditions
of population and flat topography—and remembering that the basis
of the paper is a railroad valuation for purposes of taxation, and not a
water-works appraisal for annual rate-fixing in a semi-arid region of
rapid development, or some other widely differing utility, it seems to
the writer that the author has been singularly fortunate in giving
expression to views with which specialists will for the most part agree.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>The limitations of the logical application of the methods suggested,
however, are not sufficiently defined. Early in the paper an effort is
made to avoid the necessity for this, and to simplify the treatment by
limiting the scope of the paper, in the following language:</p>

<p class='c018'>"This paper is confined to a discussion of the methods which should
be used in arriving at a correct figure of cost of reproduction and
depreciation—it does not take up questions involving the propriety of
those figures when reached. The propriety or legality of using such
figures as a basis for an assessed valuation, as a basis for rate-making, ...
will be conceded no place in this paper."</p>

<p class='c000'>Such a restriction, however, seems to the writer to leave the subject
much confused. It is impossible to judge of the propriety or soundness
of a method of valuation while ignoring its purpose and failing to
point out the limitations of its logical application. To confine discussion
to a consideration only of cost of duplication and depreciation
of physical properties is presumably an attempt to avoid the difficulties
incident to the application of such results to specific purposes, and is
in line with the frequent argument of some attorneys in litigated
valuations, that the engineer must not encroach on the province of the
Court by having, much less expressing, any idea relative to the application
of his figures to the final solution.</p>

<p class='c000'>With this doctrine the writer has no sympathy. The engineer is
essentially an economist, and no one is more fully qualified to aid,
either directly or as an adviser to the Court, in the final determination
of value for specific purposes, provided he is trained in the construction,
operation, and valuation of such properties as are under consideration.
To accept any less responsibility than this is to become
party to inferior measures leading to popular misconception, and is
justified only as a practicable first step toward the final realization
and acceptance of the larger duty.</p>

<p class='c000'>All suggested methods of valuation should be subjected to close
logical analysis, with a view to their purpose. The unsuitability of
the method used in the Michigan appraisal to many classes of appraisals
is apparent, and can be readily indicated. Much space is given to
justifying the appraisal of all so-called non-physical elements by the
capitalization of the residue of net earnings after allowing interest
on the investment in the physical properties. This the author refers
to as Professor Adams' method. The addition of the physical to the
non-physical values, as thus determined, is supposed to give the value
of the property as a whole. It is evident that it gives, by indirection,
the same total valuation as would be obtained by the direct capitalization
of net earnings without any determination of physical values,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i>, and, as a method, is therefore not what it purports to be. Since
value, by this method, is in reality dependent on earnings, it follows
that where rates are fixed by governmental authority, with the property
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>value as the base, as is done annually in California in cases of privately
owned water and lighting plants, the method suggested is without
logical application, and the property values of such corporations
must be determined and justified on other or modified grounds. Hence
the necessity for dealing with such elements as so-called "going concern,"
franchise, and other possible assets, each independently, as is
usually done in water-works appraisals, instead of collectively, as in
the Michigan appraisal.</p>

<p class='c000'>It should be made clear, therefore, that the method used in this
railroad appraisal, for the determination of non-physical values, simply
reduces the whole to one of capitalization of net earnings, and presupposes
no governmental regulation of rates with the value of the
property as the base; and, unmodified, has a comparatively narrow
range of application.</p>

<p class='c000'>The author seems to see difficulty ahead in dealing with rate-making
by this method, for he says, near the close of his paper:
"There are many intricate problems in connection with a valuation
for rate-making or taxation which really belong to these undertakings,
not to valuation," but, in stating some of these difficulties, he does not
point out the impropriety of determining value by capitalizing that
(earnings) which it may be the object of the valuation to determine
and fix.</p>

<p class='c000'>Regulation of rates by governmental authority, which means their
limitation to that which is reasonable and just, will probably in the
future be the purpose in the making of most valuations of the property
of public service corporations, and no methods or rules for the making
of appraisals can be considered as being at all complete or fairly
comprehensive which do not meet the logic of such an end.</p>

<p class='c000'>If capitalization of net earnings is to determine railroad values for
rate-fixing, whatever the process, it must presuppose a fair and equitable
rate, thus following the rate, instead of the rate following the
property value. This is but a shifting of the difficulty; for, what constitutes
a fair and just rate, irrespective of the value of the property
used, is at least as difficult of determination as is the property value,
irrespective of its earnings. Valuations, to be useful, must have their
purposes carefully predetermined, that the right application of principles
may be made.</p>

<p class='c000'>Perhaps nowhere more than in California has thought been directed
along this line, for the organic law of the State for thirty years has
required the annual fixing of rates for water and light companies by
public official bodies, and many important cases involving rates and
valuations of large properties, chiefly in later years, have been tried.
Unfortunately, the most important and best tried of these have not yet
reached the United States Supreme Court. The result, thus far, is too
long a story to be told now, but it may be said that capitalization of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>earnings in any form is not regarded as a logical basis of value under
such conditions. Franchises, as they exist here, are not regarded as
having value, unless from unusual circumstances. "Going concern"
value is recognized, but its money measure is sought through other
channels than present net earnings.</p>

<p class='c000'>The author's emphasis on the necessity for eliminating the personal
equation, as far as possible, is commendable, but a large exercise of
discretionary judgment is inseparable from the process of appraisal.
The fullest investigation of all pertinent facts should be made. Too
much must not be expected from rules and formulas. They are education
only. Governing principles must be understood, and subsequent
procedure the writer cannot better express than in the words substantially
as used on a former occasion:<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c003'><sup>[47]</sup></a> Having considered the
various factors likely to influence the value of any property under
consideration, and having summarized the results, it will remain to
determine the varying degrees of importance and weight to attach to
each, and to decide, in view of all the attendant circumstances, what
the amount is on which the company is entitled to receive a suitable
return. This final solution can never be reduced to a mathematical
formula applicable to all cases. The inquiry will have established
approximate limitations, both as to maximum and minimum, but there
will then usually be found remaining quite a wide intervening field
for the exercise of discretionary judgment.</p>

<p class='c000'>That the final result will depend to some extent on the personal
equation, does not of necessity detract from its worth. It only shows
the greatness of the problem, which requires for its solution the exercise
of faculties higher than the application of mere formulas and mere
routine, faculties which are rooted in laborious thought, in ripe experience,
in moral worth.</p>

<p class='c000'>A word concerning the use of experts on work of this class: Most
valuations grow out of or grow into cases at law. Under the prevailing
order, the litigants secure the services of the necessary expert appraisers,
who, in the course of examination, are subjected to processes usually
much better calculated to magnify than to harmonize differences, and
to cloud rather than to clarify issues, to the detriment of the record,
the confusion of the Court, and the attempted discredit of the witnesses
and their profession. Self-defense is calculated to lead witnesses
into undue reliance on rules and mathematical formulas, as direct
means of obtaining the desired result, instead of aids for the final
exercise of a right judgment as to the real value of the property for
the purpose intended, simply because it is easier in dealing with
attorneys to justify mere mathematical processes than to support
opinion resting on considerations of a general character, not always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>readily measurable in figures. This tendency leads also to under-valuations.
A change in the process of Court procedure relative to such expert
evidence is needed, and the influence of the Profession, both individually
and collectively, might be used to secure the appointment of
such witnesses at the instance of the Court, instead of the litigants,
to the great advantage, both of society and of those more immediately
concerned.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>C. D. Purdon, M. Am. Soc. C. E.</span> (by letter).—A comparison of
some of the more important items in the Minnesota valuation may be
of interest. In the "Cost of Construction of Roadbed and Track," the
principal items are:</p>

<table class='table25' summary='principal items'>

    <td class='c020'>Land</td>
    <td class='c021'>25.46%</td>

    <td class='c020'>Ties</td>
    <td class='c021'>6.72%</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c000'>These five items amount to 73.40% of the total cost, and "Adaptation
and Solidification of Roadbed" to 4.53%, the other twenty-three
items amounting to 22.07 per cent.</p>

<p class='c000'>The estimated value of "Adaptation and Solidification of Roadbed"
ranges from $543 to $1,542.80 per mile, averaging $1,231.92, which includes
4½% for engineering. If engineering is omitted, the average for
all roads is $1,124.95, and for "Carrying Roads"<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c003'><sup>[48]</sup></a> $1,128.16.</p>

<p class='c000'>The "multiplier" for cost of right of way was ascertained from the
market value of land in the vicinity, as shown by late transfers, and the
prices paid for right of way at about the same time; this cost ranged
from 195 to 891% of the market value. Taking "all roads," the cost
of land for terminals was 71.05% of the total cost of land for all
purposes, but only 3.78% of the quantity.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>A. Mordecai, M. Am. Soc. C. E.</span> (by letter).—Mr. Riggs has done
a valuable service in preparing this very able and painstaking paper,
as the subject of the proper value of Public Service Corporation
property is one but lately demanding attention. When the country
was undeveloped, and the railroad companies struggling for existence,
and often ahead of the needs of the people, no criticism was made;
but, during the last few years, securities have increased so largely, the
increased issue often being manipulated so as to accrue to the benefit
of a few individuals in place of the great mass of original security
holders, rates have been made and defended on the plea that the
increase was necessary to pay a fair interest on the capital invested,
and increases in assessments for taxes were fought and criticized to
such an extent by the companies that the public seems to think it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>absolutely necessary to have some investigating and regulating power.
It argues that the history of the past shows that we cannot depend on
the officials themselves, not from any desire to be dishonest or unfair,
but merely that they cannot reach the proper point of view. After
years of struggling, they cannot see the justice of being obliged to
show their books or have their incomes disturbed, while they see a
neighboring factory, owned by a like chartered company protected by
patents and copyrights, greatly enlarged, and the company paying a
very handsome return on an ever-increasing capital, without investigation
of any kind.</p>

<p class='c000'>No one supposes that any body of legislators or a committee selected
from one should understand the situation better than the managers
themselves, but the public, forced to look somewhere, demands that its
representatives try to regulate these matters and see that no abuses
occur, fully aware that the machinery is not perfect. It asks:</p>

<p class='c018'>As to Capital: that the company can show proper value for the
securities issued, and, if an increase is made, the sum obtained
should be used for the betterment of the property;</p>

<p class='c018'>As to Rates: the Courts have said that what the company is
entitled to ask is a fair return on the value of that which
it uses for the public convenience;</p>

<p class='c018'>As to Taxes: what is the true value of the property of the company,
treating it with absolute equality, as compared with that
of other taxpayers?</p>

<p class='c000'>It is to determine what these values are that the Engineer among
others has been called on. The literature on the subject is increasing,
and there are some decisions of the Courts which help, but there are
yet perplexing and intricate questions to be determined; not to be
answered by captious criticism and indignant retort, but by an honest
effort to arrive at some common ground of fairness to both State and
Corporation; for, after all, the Corporation is a part of the State, a
great distributor of money, a large taxpayer, its stockholders men of
worth and capacity, and there should be no desire to penalize it or
interfere with its legitimate prosperity. The Corporation is surely
dependent on the State and the good will of the people for its welfare.
Mistakes have been made, no doubt, just because this common ground
has not been reached, and the writer thinks that it is largely within the
province of the Engineer to establish it.</p>

<p class='c000'>In arriving at either of these values, the chief tangible asset is
the value of the physical property. This can be determined with a
great degree of accuracy, and though by no means alone representing
any of the values, it seems to be indispensable as a basis and starting
point. The balance sheets of the Corporation commence with a statement
of the cost of road, plant, etc., and must be checked to permit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>correct deductions from the results of operation shown in them; and,
for purposes of taxation, they would seem to be particularly reliable.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Engineer called on to make such a valuation for whatever
purpose should, under like conditions, value each item the same for
all, but it does not follow that every item, including the percentages
added, should appear in the total valuation for all purposes. There
are legitimate charges in valuations made to determine capital which
should not appear in one made for assessment for taxes. Unit prices
should not change, but the purpose for which the valuation is made
should properly be considered in arriving at the final figure.</p>

<p class='c000'>To or from this valuation, especially if made to determine proper
capital, there must be added or subtracted certain values for intangible
property, often found by a study of the income account of the Corporation.
This makes the official ask: Why make a valuation of the
physical property at all if your final result depends on the income?
Because it is one item which cannot be manipulated; it does not
change materially from year to year; it is not dependent on rates or
income; it forms a very large item in the assets of the Corporation;
and it is a sound basis on which to stand.</p>

<p class='c000'>For the purpose of determining the proper amount of securities,
the cost of reproduction at present prices would seem to be the value
sought; whereas, for taxation purposes, or to determine a proper
selling price, the present value is what is required, allowance being
made for depreciation. A railroad, for instance, might be considered
as an instrument for transporting passengers and freight, and, though
the ties are not new, the rails worn, and the locomotives of an old type,
they do their work just as safely and expeditiously, and, if no account
is to be taken of the cost of maintenance, the road might be considered
to be worth as much as if new.</p>

<p class='c000'>The officials of the Corporation are generally perfectly willing to
give any facts or to furnish access to any records they may have, but are
not willing to state their opinions as to prices, depreciation, etc. The
Engineer is making the valuation, not they; and they reserve the
right to criticize, at the proper time, both the results and the conclusions
drawn from them. The Engineer should be absolutely fair
and just, not using improperly the information obtained, but endeavoring
to reach results which appear to be unquestionably correct. He
must divest his mind of the innate desire to minimize the consequences
of his decision to the Corporation, on the one hand, or to
favor the State or his employer, on the other; it may be difficult, but
on his ability to do this depends the success or failure of his work.</p>

<p class='c000'>Considering the subject generally: in making the valuation of the
physical property, the organization should consist of one man in
charge, and under him a field organization and an office organization.
The property, if large, should be divided into convenient districts,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>with a division engineer and necessary assistants in charge of each.
Care should be taken that these assistants are competent men, though
they are often hard to obtain for temporary work of this character,
and there is not sufficient time in which to weed out and perfect an
organization. They should be men of experience on the particular
class of work to which they are assigned, and should be tactful and
courteous. Stress should be laid on keeping plain, neat notes, not too
crowded; on watchful care of the party working in the field, to prevent
accidents, and on the necessity of absolute correctness in calculations
and figures, in the multitude of which it is surprising how many
mistakes will creep in unless special care is taken to check every step
thoroughly. The office engineer should be equally competent, and
accustomed to systematizing and analyzing, so that the results will be
arranged systematically, not only as considered by themselves, but as
far as possible according to the classification of the Interstate Commerce
Commission, so that, no matter where made, they can be easily
compared.</p>

<p class='c000'>The work, if large, should be standardized. Everything to be
reported should have a form for the purpose. These should be as
concise as possible, calling attention to the essential information, but
not in too much detail. Unit prices should be established after proper
consideration.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Reproduction Value.</em>—In ascertaining the reproduction value, the
aim should be to obtain prices for which the material could be purchased
and the work let to responsible parties at the date of the
valuation. Real estate and depreciation are probably the two items
in which there will be the largest differences in opinion as to values,
and both should be determined by the personal examination of experts,
following some prearranged system. One founded on the Somers
system might do for the land, and certain percentages of depreciation
per year, varying for the three conditions of good, fair and poor, for
the structures and equipment, but the results in any case should be
examined and passed upon by some one person so as to eliminate the
individual equation as far as possible.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is when the figures thus reached are before him that the Engineer
finds himself confronted with many perplexing problems. To what
items should percentages be added, and in what amounts? A small
change in such items often makes a large difference in the total. There
is not much trouble about general expenses, legal expenses, engineering,
etc., as these are undoubtedly proper items to be added, and the
amounts of the percentages are not difficult to determine from sufficient
study of the property. Opinions on such matters will not vary
greatly, but there is a difference with regard to such items as leasehold
interests, solidification, contingencies, interest and taxes during construction,
commissions and discounts on securities, working capital,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>value of the good will, and considering the property as a "going
concern," about which opinions will differ much more widely.</p>

<p class='c000'>Leases from the company are like any other book asset. Leases
to the company should be considered as the land is considered. What
is the present value of the leasehold interest for the remainder of the
term for which the rental is fixed?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Present Value.</em>—In ascertaining the present value, it would seem
that something should be allowed for solidification, the amount depending
on the manner in which the work was built, its age, the likelihood of
damage by the elements, etc. Possibly a percentage of appreciation
on the value of the earthwork and masonry would be the fairest manner
in which to consider it. Due care must be taken, however, to give
proper credit to good work and not put a premium on inferior
construction.</p>

<p class='c000'>A percentage should be allowed for contingencies in all cases, but
this is not necessarily the same for every piece of property. The
estimate is made on a completed piece of work, consequently, if done
with proper care, this item should not be as large as if the estimate
were made for work to be constructed; but there are many things, not
seen by the estimating engineer or disclosed by available records,
which must be covered by this item, such as buildings bought with
the land and afterward destroyed, damages paid for reasons not now
apparent, difficulties encountered in excavating wet or hard material,
amounts spent in dredging, in artificial and difficult foundations, losses
during construction on account of strikes, washouts, etc. These are
perfectly legitimate charges, and are likely to have occurred, and
proper allowance should be made for them.</p>

<p class='c000'>It would seem that interest and taxes during construction is a
legitimate charge, and therefore, in the cost of reproduction, sufficient
amounts should be added to cover it. Care should be taken to make
the time long enough, as engineers are often too sanguine as to the
length of time necessary to complete a certain piece of work. It is
true that a part of a railroad, for instance, may be completed and
opened for operation, but the net revenue derived would be very
different from that of the completed road with its terminals and
connections.</p>

<p class='c000'>A new corporation can rarely market its securities at par, not only on
account of the chances taken by the investor, but also because, being
human, he likes to think he is buying at a bargain, getting something a
little below its value; consequently, inducements vary from a small discount
on bonds to a share or two of stock thrown in. To what extent a
reasonable discount is a proper charge against construction may be
considered an open question. It might seem fair that a certain fixed
percentage be allowed in valuations, to determine capital for commissions
and necessary discounts, varying according to the amount of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>securities. This need not cover the whole amount of the discount, but
only that portion which experience would consider essential in marketing
unquestioned securities.</p>

<p class='c000'>Consideration of the items working capital, good will, etc., may
not properly belong to the Engineer, but rather to the Statistician,
except as the former hears of such items being used as an argument
against the necessity for a valuation of the physical property of a
corporation. It is often asked, for instance, how can a value be placed
on the property of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, with its great
commercial position, its magnificent terminals, and its splendid organization,
all the result of the expenditure of much time and money?
It is certainly a difficult problem, but the Pennsylvania Railroad is
one of the greatest properties in America, possibly in the world, and
because the proper valuation of this property is surrounded with difficulties
it does not follow that the valuation of the properties of all
other public service corporations are equally troublesome. The very
difficulty of the task shows the importance of having firm ground for
the first step. Having that, it may not be as hard as imagined to
take others.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus it is seen that there are many perplexing questions for the
Engineer to consider, and many details for him to work out, in doing
which Mr. Riggs' paper will materially help. Above all, the Engineer
must aim to be impartial; he must arrive at such a point of view as to
see both sides with equal distinctness, and judge fairly and justly,
trying to determine some well-defined laws and formulas which will
serve as a basis in ascertaining the values desired.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>W. B. Ruggles, M. Am. Soc. C. E.</span> (by letter).—In his discussion
Mr. Lavis quotes the case assumed by the <cite>New York Sun</cite>, of two
bridges over the Ohio River—one between Cincinnati and Newport
and one 20 miles below, between villages, etc.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1898 the writer was employed by the Board of Supervisors
of Cincinnati to put a valuation on its Ohio River bridges for purposes
of taxation, and the many points of view, as to their cost and their
actual value to the owners and to the communities, were at that
time, and have been frequently since, considered by him. In this
particular valuation the duties of the Engineer were comparatively
simple and plain, for, as there were sure to be controversies on two
points at least, first, as to the right of the city to levy any tax on the
bridges as such, and second, as to whether any control by the city
extended to the center of the river, informally but generally recognized
to be the division between the cities for police and similar purposes, or
only to the northerly low-water mark, the limiting boundary to the
"Territory Northwest of the River Ohio," as recognized by the ordinance
of 1787, it appeared to the Board to be advisable, in the earlier
stages of their efforts, to avoid, as far as reasonable, any controversies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>concerning details of the valuation, and the writer was instructed to
give the bridge companies the benefit of any doubts.</p>

<p class='c000'>The railroad bridge of the Cincinnati Southern Railway, the one
lowest on the river and having the little village of Ludlow at its
southern end, and thus most nearly filling the conditions of one of the
assumed structures of the <cite>Sun</cite>, is, with its railroad, the property of the
city, and the Supervisors believed that, under the terms of the lease to
the operating company, it should not be taxed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the other four bridges, the Cincinnati and Covington Elevated
Railway and Transfer Bridge—commonly known as the Chesapeake
and Ohio Railway Bridge—the Covington and Cincinnati Suspension
Bridge, the Central Railway and Bridge Company's Bridge, and the
Newport and Cincinnati Bridge, commonly known as the Pennsylvania
Railway Bridge (all noted in the order of occurrence, passing up the
river), the writer had official or semi-official reports giving such details
of at least the principal features of the structures that in a measure
they supplied quantities, weights, and some prices; those lacking were
either calculated from actual measurements taken on the structures or
supplied from plans furnished by the companies, since, as the several
companies relied on defeating the efforts of the supervision on legal
grounds, they conceded values which otherwise might have been
strenuously contested. As long as the writer knew anything of the
results, the Board of Supervisors was unsuccessful in its purpose to
get the bridges, as such, on the tax duplicates; but that has no particular
bearing on the points raised in this discussion. Of the five bridges,
three are primarily railroad bridges. The Cincinnati Southern Bridge
has one footway only, on which it formerly collected tolls; all the others
have footways and wagonways, and the three above the Chesapeake and
Ohio Railway Bridge carry electric railways. The Newport and Cincinnati
(Pennsylvania Railway) Bridge has all the features of steam
and electric railways, wagonways and footways. In some particulars
these bridges differ greatly, for instance, the bed-rock of the river lies
at the surface of the most easterly (Pennsylvania Railway) bridge,
and for each successive bridge is found deeper, as the river is followed
westward, the river-span piers of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway
Bridge being 54 ft. below low water and those of the Cincinnati
Southern Railway Bridge being likewise very troublesome.</p>

<p class='c000'>The two bridges with exactly the same uses—double footways,
wagonways, and electric lines—are the adjacent Suspension and Central
Bridges, one having the City of Covington and the other the City
of Newport at its southern terminus, but these differ most widely as to
valuation. The Suspension Bridge, as reported to the writer by the
late W. Hildenbrand, M. Am. Soc. C. E., with the consent of his company,
was valued at only a little short of $1,000,000 as reinforced; that of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>Central Bridge Company, as reduced from the reports of the engineers,
was very nearly one-third, only, of that amount, both without any right
of way, as real estate was in all cases listed separately. At that time,
however, the traffic over the Suspension Bridge, counted in persons and
vehicles passing over its several lines, was not far from as relatively
greater than that of the Central Bridge as its valuation was higher,
and it was more indispensably necessary, as the writer views it, than
either the Central Bridge above, or the Chesapeake and Ohio Bridge
below it, for in the thirty odd years of its use (it was completed in
1867), the adjoining communities had adjusted their lines of traffic to
it, while that passing over the other two bridges occurred more because
of little differences of convenience (not, however, to be considered
otherwise than an important provision in traffic of such magnitude).</p>

<p class='c000'>Disregarding other differences, such as the unit prices of 10 or
11 cents per lb. for iron paid by the Suspension Bridge Company in
the time of the Civil War, compared with 4.47 cents per lb. for the new
cable wire or 3.32 cents per lb. for the new structural steel, it appears
to the writer that the element of more or less indispensable use by a
community, as well as the greater freedom of movement in the river
below by reason of there being no piers in the stream, are elements of
value; but that they are items to be reduced to figures for the purpose
of taxation is not so clear, any more than that there is equity in any
demand that might be made that the New York Central and New
York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad Companies should be taxed
on the additional $22,000,000 expended in the electrification of their
lines about New York City for the comfort, convenience, and edification,
not of the patrons of the roads alone, but of the public at large,
without—as just concluded by an eminently able board—any marked
economies in operation. There is no question in the writer's mind
that any one line of railroad is several times more valuable to each
individual in inland regions, such as Mexico and Arizona, than an
equal mileage in Connecticut with its Sound harbors, steamship lines,
good wagon roads, and numerous but non-competing railways, partly
because of the relative usefulness, for which no practicable substitute
could be found, and partly because these newer States have not entered
on all these multifarious lines of governmental activities, such as
policing and safeguarding for public health and the like, and, much as
funds are everywhere desirable, could possibly defer for a time some
of these developments of civic zeal. It does not appear, therefore,
that the discriminations in valuations disclosed by the author's Table 1
are altogether without a good basis in relative convenience, although
clearly extreme; but, as the law of most States is understood by the
writer, such discriminations may not usually be made with strict
regard for the legality of tax assessments.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>It is true, as remarked by Mr. Riggs, that a bridge is, of itself,
not usually a desirable feature of a railroad, but it must be clear that
if there were no river between Cincinnati and her sister cities in
Kentucky, communication between the two States might be entirely
free, and the business opening for toll bridges would not exist; consequently,
in these particular cases, the bridges cannot be considered
undesirable.</p>

<p class='c000'>One other consideration bearing on values has been at least suggested
by the study of the Cincinnati Suspension Bridge. It is, as
indicated, the oldest river bridge at Cincinnati, the second or third
oldest over the Ohio River, and, though repaired and strengthened, it
has never been supplanted by an entirely new superstructure. The
next oldest bridge is the pin-connected Pennsylvania Railway Bridge,
built five years later than the Suspension Bridge, but, at the time of
this valuation, it had been entirely replaced by quite a different
structure—even the masonry was largely rebuilt. In a degree this
comparative facility with which provisions for the greater loads can
be provided without condemnation of the leading features of the structures
has been shown in the Brooklyn and Niagara Bridges, though
not by any means perfectly, but the point the writer would make is
that this element of ease of reinforcement, or with which provision
can be made for greater loads, is to be considered in the author's
"Physical Property Elements of Value," as doubtless he has concluded.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Henry Earle Riggs, M. Am. Soc. C. E.</span> (by letter).—The discussion
of this paper has been so full, and so much of it is devoted to bringing
out methods of valuation not fully covered in the paper, that it does
not appear to the writer desirable to do more than to clear up one or
two matters which may have been left somewhat ambiguous in the
paper, and to review the main points on which there is apparent disagreement
among engineers who have engaged in valuation work.</p>

<p class='c000'>The writer wishes to express, to those who have added so materially
to the value of the paper by their discussion, his sincere appreciation
and his thanks, and he regrets that, owing to the length of the paper
and the extent of the discussion, it will be impossible to review all the
points raised.</p>

<p class='c000'>It would appear that there are a few matters in regard to which
the writer did not succeed in making his views entirely clear; consequently,
a few words on these items may not be amiss.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Overhead Charges Versus Unit Values.</em>—The point raised by Mr.
Higgins, that the determination of any percentage figures to be
applied to cover overhead charges must be carefully considered in connection
with the unit prices that have been adopted and applied to the
items of the physical inventory, is well taken. On all valuation work
with which the writer has been connected the various local conditions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>were taken into account, and, for each item a figure was used which,
it was believed, would fairly represent such price as would be named
by a contractor for the work under the existing conditions. Therefore,
all elements of hazard to contractors, and contractors' profits, have
been included in the unit price, leaving to be treated under overhead
charges only those elements of cost which the corporation under investigation
would be compelled to bear.</p>

<p class='c000'>The determination of a proper set of unit prices for a valuation
involves a very careful study of prices and local conditions, so that it
would appear to be impossible to establish any fixed rule which would
be generally applicable to all appraisals. If the unit prices adopted
be the cost to a contractor, then the overhead charges must be made
large enough to cover the contractor's hazard and profit. Every
appraisal should be accompanied with a report or statement, showing
clearly what has been done in this matter.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Items to be Inventoried.</em>—In reference to the items to be inventoried,
the construction placed on one sentence by Mr. Newton is
entirely foreign to the meaning which the writer intended to convey.
Mr. Newton's statement of his own views is entirely in harmony with
those of the writer.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Discount.</em>—Messrs. Henry C. Adams and W. H. Williams have
both discussed discount, and both take exception to the conclusions of
the writer. This would appear to be a subject on which there is disagreement
in all professions. Very able and experienced railway
managers and accountants will be found on both sides. Since the
paper was written, the writer has been engaged on the appraisal of a
comparatively new property which was defendant in a condemnation
suit. In this case, 20-year bonds were issued in 1905, and sold at an
average discount of 15 per cent. The discount has been treated as an
interest charge on the books of the company, and was being written
off from year to year. The question arose: Should the discount balance
(approximately three-quarters of the discount) be added to the
physical value and paid by the parties acquiring the property; or
should the loss be sustained by the owner? The treatment of the
account on the books of the company was in exact accord with the
writer's first contention, but a careful study of the case in hand led
to the conclusion that equity demanded inclusion of the unamortized
discount in this case. Had the condemnation taken place in 1925, after
all the discount item had been charged against operation, no part of
this amount would appear to be proper in an appraisal. This case is
cited as being the only one which has come up in the writer's practice
in which he has been inclined to recognize the propriety of including
the item. The writer is not yet convinced that his first conclusion
was in error.</p>

<p class='c000'>Professor Adams suggests several different claims made as to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>discount item. If any one of them be adopted, has suitable agreement
been advanced for treating the item as a capital charge? Clearly, the
amount of money involved in the discount item is not paid by the
company until the maturity of the bond. It is not invested in the
physical property of the company until it is paid. If written off from
year to year and charged against operation, or treated as a deduction
from earnings or from surplus, it would hardly seem proper to include
it in capital at the end of the period. The writer is open to conviction,
but he has not yet been convinced of his error on this point. Happily,
this is an item, the amount of which may be exactly determined from
the books of any company under investigation; so that, whatever the
final determination may be as to the propriety of its inclusion in an
appraisal, the amount to be treated is not a matter of estimate.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>One Value Versus Several Values.</em>—The writer has called forth discussion
on this point from several members, and, in view of some of
the discussion, he believes that a few sentences may tend to clarify
his views:</p>

<p class='c000'>(1) An appraisal should be in complete detail, and should show
fully, not only all schedules of physical property and of unit costs and
depreciation percentages on which physical values are based, but should
completely detail all schedules based on an examination of the books.</p>

<p class='c000'>(2) The final summary should include every element of value which
enters into the property, and which should enter into the "fair value"
or "true value" of the property, if valued for any purpose whatsoever.</p>

<p class='c000'>(3) An assessed value for taxation purposes should not necessarily
include all the items in the engineering valuation; but an assessment
can be made with absolute fairness if all the facts are at hand and in
such form that non-taxable items are separable.</p>

<p class='c000'>(4) If rate-making or the sale of the property be the ultimate object,
the work of making rates or of negotiating the sale can be carried
on to better advantage with a complete appraisal than with an
incomplete one.</p>

<p class='c000'>(5) The work in the States of Minnesota and Washington was
done with one object in view. It was ultimately used for another
purpose. If a low valuation is deliberately made for taxation purposes,
serious embarrassment is likely to arise when rate legislation is contemplated.
It will be very difficult for an engineer to sustain his
position when he submits one "true value" or "fair value," with the
expectation that it will be used as a figure for assessed valuation, and
another and radically different one as a basis for rate-making. It
would appear to be much easier to submit a complete set of schedules,
showing the cost of reproducing the physical property, depreciation,
present physical value, together with all other elements affecting the
final value, and then to point out that certain modifications would
appear to be proper in an assessment for taxes.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>(6) The actual making of rates or of assessments for taxation is
not a duty usually assigned to a body of engineers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Dana's discussion is directed to this phase of the subject, and
brings out a number of points which are suggested above very fully.</p>

<p class='c000'>This is a matter on which engineers have radically differed in
practice, and it involves a principle of valuation which should be
finally determined as soon as practicable. Further discussion in connection
with this paper would hardly accomplish any definite end,
therefore it is left, with emphasis on the fact that there are radical
differences of opinion regarding it.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Going Concern.</em>—The discussion of this paper, taken in connection
with the paper by Mr. Alvord before the American Water-Works
Association, and the recent paper by Messrs. Metcalf and Alvord,<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c003'><sup>[49]</sup></a>
brings out clearly three points of view:</p>

<p class='c000'>(1) That of Professor Henry C. Adams, stated by him in various
publications, and advocated by the writer in the paper: That there
is no going concern value, as such, but that all intangible elements
of value merge into one non-physical value, which may be determined
by a study of the income accounts of the particular property under
investigation.</p>

<p class='c000'>(2) The "Wisconsin Method," sometimes called the Cooley Method.
The general principles of this are described so fully and so clearly
in Mr. Gillette's discussion, under the head of Development Expense,
that further explanation is unnecessary.</p>

<p class='c000'>(3) The method advocated by Mr. Metcalf in his able discussion of
this paper, and by Messrs. Metcalf and Alvord in their paper.</p>

<p class='c000'>The writer cannot concede the accuracy of the position of Mr.
Burns, that interest during construction should be eliminated from
the physical valuation of the property and included as part of the
"going value." Interest during construction is no less a part of
the actual cost of constructing the property than the rails in a railroad
or the water pipe in a water-works plant. Nor can the writer accept
Mr. Metcalf's optimistic view of the probable action of the Supreme
Court when it will be called on to pass squarely on the "going concern"
value in a rate case. Mr. Metcalf says:</p>

<p class='c018'>"Certainly, as applied to water-works valuation, Mr. Riggs' statement
is not justified. The Maine cases clearly include going value as an
element of value on which rates should be predicated; by inference, so
does the Kansas City case. In the Knoxville case it was in fact
allowed by the Master."</p>

<p class='c000'>This is all true. The Knoxville case, however, reached the Supreme
Court, and the Supreme Court squarely side-stepped "going value" in
the following words:</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>"We express no opinion as to the propriety of these two items
['organization promotion, etc.,' and 'going concern'], in the valuation
of the plant for the purpose for which it was valued in this case, but
leave that question to be considered when it necessarily arises."</p>

<p class='c000'>Judge Lurton, in upholding an intangible value in the Omaha case,
and quoting among others the Kansas City case and the Gloucester
and Norwich cases, which approved and followed the Kansas City case,
significantly adds:</p>

<p class='c018'>"No such question was considered on Knoxville Water Co. [212
U. S., 1] or Wilcox <em>vs.</em> Consolidated Gas Co. [212 U. S., 19]; both
cases were rate cases, and did not concern the ascertainment of value
under contracts of sale."</p>

<p class='c000'>The writer quite inclines to the views expressed by Mr. Gillette,
and fails to read any approval of "going concern" or "going value,"
as advanced by our water-works brethren, when the determination of a
value on which to base rates is the issue.</p>

<p class='c000'>That there is sound logic in Mr. Gillette's argument for development
expense—which differs in the last analysis but little from Mr.
Metcalf's presentation of "going value"—the writer will admit. There
are many corporations in existence to-day which have made substantial
investments in creating a successful business after the physical plant
was completed and in operation. It hardly seems equitable that such
an investment should not be taken into account in fixing a value. The
real difficulty lies in drawing the line between the really valuable
property, and one which is truly a profitable investment, and that property
which, by reason of poor business judgment in its creation, faulty
or uneconomical construction or bad management, is not earning a
reasonable profit.</p>

<p class='c000'>The writer has given some study to the theory advanced by Professor
Cooley in the Milwaukee Street Railway case, and later adopted by the
Wisconsin Commission in the Antigo Water case, but is not yet ready
to accept it. The hypothetical curve appears to be acceptable and
reasonable, but the actual application of the formula to cases which
have come under the writer's attention, fails to show a profit at the end
of a period of years. If the rule be stated: "the greater the deficit in
earnings the greater the value," then this method may be of general
application, but it does not appeal to the writer as sound business to
advocate the assigning of any non-physical or "going" value to a
property unless the property has, for some years, actually been earning
a return on the investment which is large enough to justify fully
the claim that it is worth more than it cost, or more than its present
physical value. If, during the first few years, there was a deficit, due
to the expense of creating the demand for the commodity produced
and building up the business to a profitable condition, it may be sound
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>to include this element in an appraisal. The actual cost may be determined,
but the cost of reproduction is pure speculation. The actual
cost of a ton of rail, a locomotive, a boiler, or the copper for a transmission
line bought fifteen years ago may be radically different from
the cost of reproduction of the same physical things to-day; but that
cost of reproduction is radically determined as the things are being
bought and sold in the open market. Not so, however, with the
development charge, or cost of creating a business. Conditions are not
the same, they may not be at all similar.</p>

<p class='c000'>Without arguing the subject further, the writer submits that this is
a matter that requires the greatest of care in its treatment. The
adoption of any rule which will assign a "going value" to a property
which has been managed so that it not only has never earned a large
return on the investment, but has not taken care of depreciation—a
property which would not appeal to financial men as a sound investment
at its physical valuation—will not only be difficult to sustain in
the Courts, but will tend to discredit the entire subject of valuation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The writer's present feeling is that the term "going concern" ought
to be eliminated from the nomenclature of valuation practice, and that
scant consideration ought to be given to any attempt to include anticipated
profits in any manner in a valuation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Kuichling has suggested that some further data as to the
Michigan Appraisal might be of value. Unfortunately, the writer has
not in available form information as to different classes of railroads.
Table 15, based on the average of all the roads in Michigan, was prepared
by James Walker, Chief Engineer of the Michigan Board of
State Tax Commissioners, after the completion of the Michigan
Appraisal. Column 2 gives the percentage of each item to the entire
cost of reproduction. Column 3 gives the average percentage of conditions.
The remaining four columns give the average cost of reproduction
per mile on various mileage bases.</p>

<p class='c000'>It must be borne in mind that Michigan is geographically unlike
any other State in the Union, that the mileage of high-class main-line
railroad is relatively small, and that there is a large mileage of
cheap branch lines and logging roads. As a result, these general
averages are of little value for comparison with similar figures in other
States, where trunk-line mileage forms a greater percentage of the
entire mileage.</p>

<p class='c000'>In closing, the writer believes that it is but justice to himself to
correct a few misleading statements in Mr. Williams' discussion which
might cause serious misunderstanding of the writer's views.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Williams refers to his discussion of Professor Adams'
paper before the American Economic Association in December, 1909,
he also again refers to the same paper, and conveys the impression that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>the writer discussed this particular article in the paper before this
Society.</p>

<p class='c000'>Reference to page <a href='#Page_105'>105</a> will show that the writer did not refer to
this paper (which, in fact, he did not see until his own paper was
in print), but to one written by Mr. Williams in January, 1909, and
given the widest publicity, not only by its distribution in pamphlet
form, but by publication in the columns of <cite>Railway Age Gazette</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The writer does not care to permit to go unnoticed the imputation
that he has attacked railroad officials as a class. If such inference is
to be drawn from this paper, he desires to correct it.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>The writer was in railway service for some years, for six years in
an official position. For the past fifteen years he has been, at frequent
intervals, on special service for railroads. He is at present under employment
by two of the principal railways of the country. He has
many warm friends in the service, many in official capacities, and he is
fully cognizant of the high ability, integrity, and loyalty of railway
employees, and by employees he means to be understood as including
all classes, from the highest officials down.</p>

<p class='c000'>Inasmuch as our railroads form our greatest industry, and inasmuch
as the active heads of the large roads have under their control
such properties as but few in other fields are called to administer, it
follows that there are hundreds—yes, thousands—of men in railway
service, competent to fill any office in the land. The writer repeats:
it is a pity that the demands of their work are such that they cannot
give more of the benefit of their highly specialized training to the
public service, and that they have so often apparently misunderstood
or misconstrued the perfectly honest attempts of public officials to find
a remedy for real evils.</p>

<p class='c000'>In closing, the writer desires to say that he regrets the impossibility
of treating the subjects of depreciation and fair return in a satisfactory
manner without unduly lengthening this discussion.</p>

<p class='c000'>It may not be out of place to say that, in the writer's opinion, a fair
return on the average public service corporation property should be
considerably in excess of the figures usually named. There is but little
incentive to invest in railways, street railways, or other public service
corporations, if the limit of return is to be 7%, or 8%, or even 10%,
on the actual investment. This is especially true where the hazard
of investment is increased by term franchises under which the companies
are operating. The writer has the most absolute confidence in
the ability and integrity of our Supreme Court, and is led to believe
that, on a proper showing, confiscation will not be permitted.</p>

<p class='c000'>He also believes that, in general, the great mass of intelligent people
wish only absolutely fair dealing with the corporations.</p>

<p class='c000'>On making a full and frank showing of facts and conditions, the
public service corporation which is honestly financed and honestly
operated, need have little fear of ultimate justice.</p>

<p class='c000'>The public service corporation which is administered, not to render
service to the public, but to permit stock speculators to reap a harvest,
can hardly hope for the same brand of justice, and it is hardly to be
expected that such a corporation will welcome publicity.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
